# Lean Feedback JSON Structure

## Pithy, Deficit-Driven, Actionable Feedback

---

## Design Principles

1. **Pithy** — Say it in one sentence if possible
2. **Deficit-driven** — Focus on what's wrong, not praise
3. **Actionable** — Tell them exactly what to do
4. **No fluff** — Cut congratulations, padding, and repetition

### Example: Student Review Screen

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 REVIEW: de Broglie Wavelength                47/54 (87%)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠ MOMENTUM-WAVELENGTH RELATIONSHIP          4/6 errors
  
  Your error: "directly proportional" (×2), "increase" (×2)
  
  → You have the relationship backwards.
  → Fix: p is in the denominator. Bigger denominator = smaller result.
  → Do this: Calculate λ for p = 1 and p = 10. Which gives bigger λ?
  
  Correct: More momentum → shorter wavelength (INVERSE)
  
  Status: Fixed by Round 3 ✓

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

⚠ DE BROGLIE FORMULA                         1/5 errors

  Your error: "λ = hp"
  
  → Wrong operation. It's division, not multiplication.
  → Fix: λ = h/p means h DIVIDED BY p.
  → Do this: Check units: (J·s)/(kg·m/s) = meters. Does hp give meters?
  
  Status: Fixed by Round 2 ✓

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓ PLANCK'S CONSTANT                          0/2 errors

  No issues.

### Example: Persistent Error

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚨 MOMENTUM-WAVELENGTH RELATIONSHIP          6/6 errors

  Wrong in ALL rounds.
  
  Your error: "directly proportional" (×4), "increase" (×2)
  
  Gap: You don't understand inverse relationships in formulas.
  
  Action: Review—when a variable is in the denominator, 
  increasing it DECREASES the result. Practice with λ = h/p 
  using real numbers.
  
  Do not proceed until you understand this concept.

## Comparison: Verbose vs Lean

### ❌ Verbose (Before)
```
Great improvement! You initially struggled with this concept 
but got it right in later rounds. This shows real learning!

Your answers:
• Round 1: "directly proportional" 
• Round 2: "directly proportional"

Diagnosis: You assumed momentum and wavelength increase together.

Correction: Look at the formula λ = h/p. Since p is in the 
DENOMINATOR, increasing p makes λ smaller. This is an INVERSE 
relationship.

Hint: Think about fractions: 1/2 is bigger than 1/4. Bigger 
denominator = smaller result.

Key Understanding:
• λ = h/p means INVERSE relationship
• More momentum → shorter wavelength
• Less momentum → longer wavelength

Remember: λ = h/p means inverse proportionality. You've now 
demonstrated this understanding. Well done!
```

### ✓ Lean (After)
```
Your error: "directly proportional" (×2)

→ You have the relationship backwards.
→ Fix: p is in the denominator. Bigger denominator = smaller result.
→ Do this: Calculate λ for p = 1 and p = 10. Which gives bigger λ?

Correct: More momentum → shorter wavelength (INVERSE)

Status: Fixed by Round 3 ✓

## Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Pithy** | Each field is 1-2 sentences max |
| **Deficit-driven** | Focus on `error`, `gap`—what's wrong |
| **Actionable** | Every error has an `action` field with imperative verb |
| **No fluff** | No "Great job!", no padding, no repetition |

The feedback tells students:
1. **What you got wrong** (the error)
2. **Why it's wrong** (the fix)
3. **What to do about it** (the action)

Nothing more.
