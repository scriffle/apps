Generic Web App Template - Core Feature Requirements
When building this web app, please assume and implement the following foundational features unless explicitly stated otherwise:
Layout & Responsiveness

Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
Dynamically resizes to fill available viewport (no wasted space)
Uses clamp(), viewport units (vw/vh), CSS Grid, and Flexbox
Mobile-first with proper viewport meta tag
Minimum 375px width support, scales gracefully to desktop
No fixed pixel dimensions for main containers

Touch & Input Interface

Full touch support: tap, drag, swipe gestures
Pinch-to-zoom where appropriate
Minimum 44px touch targets
Touch and mouse event parity
Keyboard shortcuts for power users (document these in a help section)
Escape key cancels/closes any open panel or action
Enter key confirms/submits
Prevent unwanted key repeats on critical actions

Non-Modal UI Philosophy

No alert(), confirm(), or prompt() dialogs ever
Use inline panels, slide-out drawers, and expandable sections
Inline editing with save/cancel controls
Two-click delete pattern (first click shows "Confirm?", second deletes)
Toast notifications for transient feedback
Settings in a sliding panel from screen edge

State Management

Full undo/redo system with ~100 state history
Deep clone snapshots of application state
Undo/Redo includes UI state, not just data
Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y (or Cmd on Mac)
Visual indication of undo/redo availability

Persistence & Recovery

localStorage for all user data and preferences
Auto-save on every meaningful change
Save on beforeunload and visibilitychange events
Crash recovery: restore full state on reload
Named save slots where appropriate
CSV or JSON export/import for data backup

Multi-Tab Architecture

Tab-based navigation for distinct functional areas
Tabs remember their scroll position and state
Clean tab switching without data loss
Visual indication of active tab
Keyboard navigation between tabs (arrow keys or number keys)

Dynamic Updates

UI updates reactively when data changes
No manual refresh required after actions
Smooth transitions between states
Loading indicators for async operations
Optimistic UI updates where appropriate

Visual Feedback & Polish

CSS transitions on all interactive elements (0.2-0.3s)
Hover states (with touch device fallbacks)
Active/pressed states for buttons
Disabled states clearly visible
Tooltips with 1-1.5s delay, hide on mouse movement
Subtle animations for state changes

Drag & Drop

Visual feedback during drag (opacity, shadow, cursor)
Drop zone highlighting
Escape cancels drag operation
Drag off-canvas to delete (where appropriate)
Snap-to-grid or snap-to-position options

Settings & Preferences

Sliding settings panel
Grouped, logical settings sections
All settings persist in localStorage
Settings apply immediately (live preview)
Reset to defaults option

Inline Editing

Click-to-edit pattern for editable fields
Clear visual edit mode
Save/Cancel button pair
Validation before save with inline error display
Escape cancels edit, Enter saves (for single fields)

Status Communication

Persistent status bar or area for contextual messages
Clear feedback for all user actions
Error states with red/warning styling
Success confirmations
Processing/loading states

Easter Eggs

Include at least one hidden feature or fun surprise
Discoverable through unusual interaction patterns
Document internally with // EASTER EGG: comments
Should delight without disrupting functionality

Code Quality

Clean, readable, well-commented code
Consistent naming conventions
Logical function organization
No console errors in normal operation
Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
