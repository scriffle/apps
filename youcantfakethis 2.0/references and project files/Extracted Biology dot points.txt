| 10 | Formation of polypeptides via condensation reactions: peptide bonds between the amine and carboxylic acid groups of adjacent amino acids |
| 11 | The four levels of protein structure and the bonds/interactions responsible for each level: |
|    | • Primary (1°): sequence of amino acids; covalent peptide bonds |
|    | • Secondary (2°): α-helices and β-pleated sheets; hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms |
|    | • Tertiary (3°): 3D shape; interactions between R groups (H-bonds, disulfide bridges, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions) |
|    | • Quaternary (4°): multiple polypeptide chains or prosthetic groups |
| 12 | Denaturation as a structural change resulting in loss of biological properties, caused by temperature or pH changes affecting hydrogen bonds and protein charge |
| 13 | The diverse functions of proteins: structural (collagen), hormones (insulin), immunity (antibodies), transport (haemoglobin), enzymes (catalase), movement (actin, myosin) |
| 14 | The proteome as the totality of proteins expressed within a cell, tissue or organism at a given time; proteome diversity from alternative splicing and post-translational modifications |

### Gene Expression

| 16 | The structure of genes: promoter (initiation site for RNA polymerase), coding sequence (transcribed region), and terminator (termination site) |
| 17 | Transcription: RNA polymerase binds to promoter, separates DNA strands, synthesises complementary RNA strand, and detaches at terminator |
| 18 | RNA processing in eukaryotes: capping (5' methyl group), polyadenylation (3' poly-A tail), and splicing (removal of introns, joining of exons) |
| 19 | Alternative splicing: selective removal of exons resulting in different polypeptides from a single gene sequence |
| 20 | Translation: ribosomes read mRNA codons (starting at AUG), tRNA anticodons align via complementary base pairing, peptide bonds form between amino acids, termination at stop codons |

| 24 | Transcription factors as proteins that mediate or impede RNA polymerase binding: repressors (prevent transcription) and activators (promote transcription) |
| 25 | The operator region in prokaryotes as a binding site for transcription factors adjacent to the promoter |
| 26 | The trp operon as a simplified example of gene regulation: a cluster of genes under control of a single promoter, regulated by the trp repressor |
| 27 | Regulation of the trp operon: when tryptophan is high, it binds to trp repressor (activating it) which blocks the operator and prevents transcription; when tryptophan is low, the repressor is inactive and transcription proceeds |

## Area of Study 1: How do organisms respond to pathogens?

### Pathogens

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | The distinction between disease (condition disturbing normal physiology) and infectious disease (caused by transmissible pathogens) |
| 2 | Cellular pathogens: parasites that grow and feed on hosts; includes fungi (yeasts, moulds), bacteria (prokaryotes producing toxins), protozoa (Plasmodium, Trypanosoma), helminths (roundworm, tapeworm), ectoparasites (arthropods, insects) |
| 3 | Non-cellular pathogens: viruses (nucleic acid core, protein capsid, some with lipid envelope; lytic vs lysogenic cycles; DNA adenoviruses vs RNA retroviruses) and prions (abnormally folded proteins causing spongiform encephalopathy) |
| 4 | Self-antigens: MHC molecules on nucleated cells identifying cells as 'self'; unique to host; basis for tissue rejection and self-tolerance |
| 5 | Non-self antigens: pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) for innate recognition; specific epitopes recognised by antibodies (paratopes) for adaptive immunity |
| 6 | Allergens as environmental substances triggering immune responses in pre-sensitised individuals; IgE antibodies priming mast cells; histamine release causing allergic reactions |

### Surface Barriers (First Line of Defence)

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 7 | Physical barriers: intact skin (dry, thick, dead cells) and mucous membranes (thin, living cells; ciliated for pathogen removal; secretions like tears and mucus) |
| 8 | Chemical barriers: sebaceous gland secretions (fatty acids, lactic acid), lysozyme in tears and saliva, acidic environments (stomach, genitourinary tract) |
| 9 | Microbiota barriers: normal flora (commensals) occupying intestinal surfaces, preventing colonisation by pathogens |
| 10 | Plant barriers: waxy cuticle, thorns, gall formation, antimicrobial chemicals (saponins, resins, tannins, defensins), oils repelling insect pests, gum secretion and abscission |

### Leukocytes

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 11 | White blood cells (leukocytes) as the cellular component of immunity: granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes |
| 12 | Neutrophils: most abundant; first responders; destroy pathogens via phagocytosis; short-lived; form majority of pus |
| 13 | Eosinophils: prominent at allergic reactions and parasitic infections; release chemical products to perforate cell membranes; target multicellular parasites |
| 14 | Mast cells and basophils: initiate inflammation by releasing histamine and heparin; mast cells localised, basophils circulate |
| 15 | Monocytes: largest leukocytes; phagocytose and present antigens; differentiate into macrophages (tissue-based, longer-lasting) and dendritic cells (better antigen presentation) |
| 16 | Natural killer (NK) cells: target virally-infected and cancerous body cells; non-specific lymphocytes; recruited by interferon; release perforins and granzymes |

### Innate Immunity (Second Line of Defence)

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 17 | Characteristics of innate immunity: non-specific (cannot differentiate between microorganisms) and non-adaptive (no memory; same response every time) |
| 18 | Phagocytosis: extravasation of leukocytes from blood; chemotaxis (attraction by chemokines); engulfment via pseudopodia; fusion with lysosome (phagolysosome); digestion |
| 19 | Inflammation: histamine release from mast cells/basophils causing vasodilation and increased capillary permeability; recruitment of leukocytes; side effects (redness, heat, swelling, tenderness); acute vs chronic |
| 20 | Complement proteins: synthesised by liver; enhance phagocyte activity; form membrane attack complex (MAC); aid chemotaxis; opsonisation (coating pathogens) |
| 21 | Cytokines as signalling proteins regulating immune communication: chemokines, interleukins, tumor necrosis factors |
| 22 | Interferons: cytokines providing protection against virally-infected and cancer cells; alert surrounding cells; recruit NK cells |
| 23 | Clotting: platelets forming plug; coagulation cascade converting fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin mesh; prevents pathogen access to bloodstream |
| 24 | Fever: elevated body temperature triggered by prostaglandins; reduces pathogen growth rate; increases metabolic activity; can damage host enzymes if excessive |

### Lymphatic System

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 25 | The lymphatic system as a transport network for immune response: antigen presenting cells drain from blood/tissues into lymph |
| 26 | Primary lymphoid organs: bone marrow (blood cell production from hematopoietic stem cells) and thymus (T lymphocyte maturation via positive and negative selection) |
| 27 | Secondary lymphoid organs: spleen (stores leukocytes) and lymph nodes (filtration points with lymphocyte-rich lobules for antigen presentation) |
| 28 | The role of lymph nodes in connecting innate and adaptive immunity: antigen presenting cells display antigens to B and T lymphocytes |

### Adaptive Immunity (Third Line of Defence)

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 29 | Characteristics of adaptive immunity: specific (differentiates between microorganisms) and adaptive (memory cells enable heightened response upon re-exposure) |
| 30 | Antigen presentation: MHC class I markers present endogenous antigens to cytotoxic T cells (cell-mediated immunity); MHC class II markers present exogenous antigens to helper T cells (humoral immunity) |
| 31 | Clonal selection: specific lymphocyte activated by particular antigen divides to form clones; polyclonal activation when pathogen has multiple antigens |
| 32 | Cell-mediated immunity: cytotoxic T cells target intracellular threats (virally-infected, cancerous cells); release perforating enzymes causing lysis |
| 33 | Humoral immunity: helper T cells activate B lymphocytes via cytokines; B cells differentiate into plasma cells producing antigen-specific antibodies |
| 34 | Antibody structure: 4 polypeptide chains forming Y-shape; variable regions (antigen binding); constant regions (immune system recognition); specificity from VDJ gene recombination |
| 35 | Antibody functions: precipitation, agglutination, neutralisation, inflammation enhancement, complement activation, opsonisation |
| 36 | Immunological memory: memory B cells and memory T cells produced during clonal expansion; faster antibody production upon re-exposure; basis for immunity |

### Types of Immunity

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 37 | Active immunity: production of antibodies by the body itself with memory cell development; provides long-term immunity |
| 38 | Passive immunity: acquisition of antibodies from external source without memory cell development; provides short-term immunity |
| 39 | Natural active immunity: antibody production in response to pathogenic infection |
| 40 | Artificial active immunity: antibody production in response to vaccination (controlled exposure to attenuated pathogen) |
| 41 | Natural passive immunity: receiving antibodies from another organism (e.g., breast milk to newborn) |
| 42 | Artificial passive immunity: receiving manufactured antibodies via external delivery (e.g., monoclonal antibody transfusion) |

## Area of Study 2: How are pathogens controlled?

### Disease Spread

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | Outbreak definitions: outbreak (sudden rise in disease occurrence), epidemic (within specific community/region), pandemic (intercontinental/global spread) |
| 2 | Drivers of disease outbreaks: globalisation of travel and trade, deforestation (increased zoonotic exposure), climate change (altered vector distributions) |
| 3 | Historical outbreak example: European settlement in Australia introducing epidemic diseases (smallpox, measles, influenza) to Indigenous populations lacking immunity; estimated 50-70% mortality in Sydney area from smallpox |
| 4 | Impact of European colonisation on Indigenous health: land appropriation affecting food sources, establishment of permanent camps lacking sanitation, malnutrition, adoption of European dress without washing traditions |

### Antigenic Variation

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 5 | Emergence of new pathogens through antigenic variation: changes in surface proteins affecting antibody recognition |
| 6 | Antigenic drift: gradual change from accumulating point mutations; leads to seasonal reoccurrences; requires booster vaccinations |
| 7 | Antigenic shift: sudden dramatic change from gene segment reassortment when cells infected with multiple viral strains; can cross species barriers; can cause pandemics |

### Antibiotic Resistance

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 8 | Antibiotics as chemicals targeting prokaryotic cell features: broad spectrum (target many bacteria) vs narrow spectrum (more specific) |
| 9 | Development of antibiotic resistance: gene mutations in bacterial colonies; selection pressure from antibiotic use; resistant bacteria survive and reproduce via binary fission |
| 10 | Spread of antibiotic resistance: resistant bacteria flourish without competition; horizontal gene transfer via bacterial conjugation (plasmid transfer); example: MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) |

### Disease Control - Scientific Strategies

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 11 | Epidemiology as the study of disease distribution, determinants, and control applications |
| 12 | Pathogen identification techniques: PCR analysis (fluorescent primers, amplification of viral sequences), blood cultures (growing pathogen cultures), Western blotting (gel electrophoresis for antigen isolation), ELISA (capture and detection antibodies) |
| 13 | Modes of transmission: direct (physical contact, droplet spread) and indirect (airborne, non-living vehicles like food/faeces/fomites, biological vectors) |
| 14 | Zoonotic diseases: transferred from animal hosts (vertebrates) to humans; animals as reservoirs enabling re-emergence; examples: rabies, bird flu, swine flu |
| 15 | Vector-borne diseases: transferred between humans by animal carriers; mechanical vectors (transmit externally, remain uninfected) vs biological vectors (pathogen undergoes lifecycle stages); example: malaria (Plasmodium in Anopheles mosquito) |
| 16 | Scientific strategies for disease control: vaccinations (herd immunity), rational drug design (antibiotics), contact tracing and databases, quarantine/lockdowns, sterilisation (chlorination, fumigation), genetic engineering of vectors (sterile mosquitoes) |

### Disease Control - Social Strategies

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 17 | Social strategies as government policies supporting scientific interventions |
| 18 | Types of social strategies: advertisement campaigns for risk awareness, education programmes on hygiene practices (social distancing, insecticide use), funding for vaccinations and equipment, laws and mandates for compliance |

### Vaccination

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 19 | Vaccinations as artificial active immunity: containing antigens to trigger immunity without causing disease |
| 20 | Components and mechanism: weakened/attenuated pathogen with antigenic determinants conjugated to adjuvant (boosts immune response); triggers primary immune response and memory cell production |
| 21 | Benefits of vaccination: limits pathogen spread, reduces mortality and crippling effects |
| 22 | Limitations of vaccination: protection may not be lifelong (booster shots required), some individuals may have adverse reactions |
| 23 | Herd immunity: non-vaccinated individuals protected by large proportion of immune individuals; important for vulnerable populations (elderly, young, immunocompromised) |
| 24 | Factors affecting herd immunity threshold: mode of transmission, period of infectivity, population density, social behaviour patterns; ~80-90% for airborne pathogens like coronavirus |
| 25 | Case study - smallpox eradication: targeted by WHO in 1967, declared eradicated in 1980; success factors: easily identifiable symptoms, direct contact transmission only, no animal vectors, short infection period, stable virus (no mutations), global cooperation, long-term immunity |

### Immunotherapy

| # | Dot Point |
|---|-----------|
| 26 | Immunotherapy as treatment using substances that moderate immune response: activation immunotherapies (elicit/amplify response) vs suppression immunotherapies (reduce response) |
| 27 | Monoclonal antibodies: specific antibodies derived from single B cell clone; produced by hybridoma cells (plasma cells fused with immortal tumor cells) |
| 28 | Monoclonal antibodies in cancer treatment: binding to neoantigens for opsonisation, targeting immune checkpoint regulators, conjugation to chemotherapy agents for targeted delivery |
| 29 | Autoimmune diseases: immune system fails to recognise self, targeting own cells/tissues; caused by antigenic mimicry and cross-reactivity; examples: type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis |
| 30 | Monoclonal antibodies in autoimmune treatment: targeting pro-inflammatory proteins (e.g., TNF) to reduce inflammation; targeting surface proteins involved in B cell proliferation |
