Metabolism

Key Knowledge:

    The general structure of the biochemical pathways in photosynthesis and cellular respiration from initial reactant to final product


Most cellular processes involve chains and cycles of biochemical reactions, with each step controlled by a separate, specific enzyme

    Metabolism describes the totality of enzyme-catalysed reactions that occur within a living organism in order to maintain life
    Having metabolic pathways moderated by a series of sequential enzymes allows for a greater level of regulatory control


Types of Metabolic Reactions

Metabolic reactions can typically be categorised according to two main types: anabolic reactions or catabolic reactions

    Anabolic reactions build complex molecules from simpler subunits (for organic monomers, this involves condensation polymerisation)
    Catabolic reactions break down complex molecules into smaller components (for organic polymers, this involves hydrolysis reactions)


metabolism


There are a variety of anabolic reactions that involve organic molecules (all of which can be reversed catabolically via hydrolysis)

    Monosaccharides (e.g. glucose) are joined via glycosidic linkages to form polysaccharides (e.g. glycogen or starch)
    Glycerol and fatty acids are joined to form triglycerides (or phospholipids if a phosphate group is also involved)
    Amino acids are joined via peptide bonds to form polypeptide chains (via the process of translation)
    Nucleotides are joined into polynucleotide chains (RNA or DNA) via the processes of trancription or DNA replication


Biochemical Pathways

Two examples of biochemical pathways which are complementary are photosynthesis (anabolic) and cellular respiration (catabolic)

    The products of photosynthesis function as the inputs of aerobic cellular respiration (oxygen and glucose)
    The products of aerobic cellular respiration function as the inputs of photosynthesis (carbon dioxide and water)


Most producers (i.e. photoautotrophs) will use both photosynthesis and cell respiration in order to survive, whereas consumers (heterotrophs) can only undertake cell respiration and rely on the ingestion or absorption of photosynthetic products to survive

photo vs resp


Photosynthesis versus Cell Respiration

The general structure of the biochemical pathways in photosynthesis and cell respiration are effectively reversed

    Photosynthesis uses an electron transport chain to generate chemical energy for a subsequent Calvin cycle which forms glucose
    Aerobic respiration uses the Krebs cycle to break down glucose in order to generate energy (ATP) via an electron transport chain


Photosynthesis involves the anabolic production of glucose from inorganic components (using light as an initial energy source)

    Water is broken down by sunlight (photolysis) into hydrogen and oxygen (a waste product)
    Chlorophyll absorbs light energy which is used by an electron transport chain to produce ATP (photophosphorylation)
    The hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide (and ATP) to form glucose via the Calvin cycle (i.e. anabolism)


Cell respiration involves the catabolic digestion of glucose into inorganic components (releasing chemical energy as ATP)

    Glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and hydrogen via glycolysis and the Krebs cycle (i.e. catabolism)
    The hydrogen is used by an electron transport chain in order to produce ATP (oxidative phosphorylation)
    Oxygen collects the de-energised hydrogen to form water (a waste product)

Catalysts
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The general role of enzymes and coenzymes in facilitating steps in photosynthesis and cellular respiration


A catalyst is a substance that enables a chemical reaction to proceed at a faster rate or under different conditions (e.g. lower temperature)

    Catalysts lower the amount of energy required for a reaction to proceed (activation energy), allowing a reaction to occur more readily
    Catalysts are not changed or consumed by the reactions they influence and so occur at relatively low levels and can be re-used


Enzymes

Enzymes are globular proteins which act as biological catalysts and speed up the rate of a reaction by lowering the activation energy

    Every enzyme will only react with specific molecule called a substrate, which binds to a region of the enzyme called the active site
    The active site and substrate will complement each other in terms of both shape and chemical properties (e.g. opposite charges)


When a substrate binds to the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex is formed (as per the ‘lock and key’ model)

    The active site is not completely rigid however and may undergo a conformational change in shape to better fit the substrate
    This conformational change may stress and destabilise the bonds in the substrate, hence lowering the activation energy
    When the substrate has been converted into a product, it will dissociate from the enzyme (allowing the enzyme to be re-used)


enzyme


Enzyme reactions typically occur in aqueous solutions as these reflect the internal conditions of an organism (cytoplasm, interstitial fluid)

    Consequently, the substrate and enzyme are usually moving randomly within the solution (Brownian motion) until a successful collision 
    Sometimes an enzyme may be fixed in position (e.g. if it is membrane-bound) – this will serve to localise the reaction to a particular site


Coenzymes

A coenzyme is a complex organic molecule that is required for an enzyme’s metabolic activity (it assists with the catalysis of a reaction)

    Coenzymes cycle between two states: a loaded form that can be used and an unloaded form (similar to a charged or expended battery)
    Examples of biologically significant coenzymes include ATP (transfers energy) and hydrogen carriers (transfers protons and electrons)


Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a high energy molecule that functions as an immediate source of power for cell processes

    One molecule of ATP contains three covalently linked phosphate groups – which store potential energy in their bonds
    When ATP is hydrolysed (to form ADP + Pi) the energy stored in the phophate bond is released to be used by the cell


ATP


Hydrogen Carriers

Hydrogen carriers are coenzymes that transport protons and electrons between chemical reactions (functions like a chemical taxi)

    Hydrogen carriers are loaded by oxidation reactions (become reduced), and unloaded in reduction reactions (become oxidised)
    The protons and electrons can be used to help synthesise organic macromolecules via anabolic reactions (e.g. photosynthesis)
    Hydrogen carriers also function as intermediate energy sources (via their energised electrons) and can be used to make ATP
    Examples of hydrogen carriers include NADH and FADH2 (used by mitochondria), as well as NADPH (used by the chloroplast)

Enzyme Activity
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The general factors that impact on enzyme function in relation to photosynthesis and cellular respiration: changes in temperature, pH, concentration, competitive and non-competitive enzyme inhibitors

    Factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis: light availability, water availability, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration

    Factors that affect the rate of cellular respiration: temperature, glucose availability and oxygen concentration


The rate of enzyme catalysis can be increased by improving the frequency of successful collisions via:

    Increasing the molecular motion of the particles (thermal energy can be introduced to increase kinetic energy)
    Increasing the concentration of particles (either by increasing the substrate or enzyme concentrations)
    Maintaining enzyme-substrate specificity (enzyme denaturation will change the conformation of the active site)


Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

The three main conditions that may affect the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction are temperature, pH and substrate concentration

Temperature

    Low temperatures result in insufficient thermal energy for the activation of an enzyme-catalysed reaction to proceed
    Increasing the temperature will increase the speed and motion of both enzyme and substrate, resulting in higher enzyme activity
    This is because a higher kinetic energy will result in more frequent successful collisions between the enzymes and substrates
    At an optimal temperature (which may vary for different enzymes), the rate of enzyme activity will be at its peak (highest level)
    Higher temperatures will cause enzyme stability to decrease, as the thermal energy disrupts the enzyme’s hydrogen bonds
    This causes the enzyme (particularly the active site) to lose its shape, resulting in the loss of activity (as denaturation occurs)


pH

    Changing the pH will alter the charge of the enzyme, which in turn will alter protein solubility and overall enzyme shape
    Changing the shape or charge of the active site will diminish its ability to bind the substrate, abrogating enzyme function
    Enzymes have an optimal pH (may differ between enzymes) and moving outside this range diminishes enzyme activity


Substrate Concentration

    Increasing the substrate concentration will increase the activity of a corresponding enzyme
    More substrates mean there is an increased chance of enzyme and substrate colliding and reacting within a given period
    After a certain point, the rate of activity will cease to rise regardless of any further increases in substrate levels
    This is because the environment is saturated with substrate and all enzymes are bound and reacting (Vmax)



Limiting Factors

When a chemical process depends on multiple conditions, the reaction rate will be limited by the factor nearest to its minimum value

    This is known as the law of limiting factors (i.e. the factor in the shortest supply will determine the rate of the biochemical process)


In complex biochemical pathways, the initial inputs (reactants) affect overall reaction rates in a manner akin to substrate concentration

    Glucose is an initial input for the process of cell respiration, while carbon dioxide is an initial input for the process of photosynthesis
    Oxygen is an initial input for aerobic respiration only and so will not directly impact the rate of anaerobic respiration or fermentation
    Water availability may be hard to assess for photosynthesis, as water can be produced by cell respiration or condensation reactions
    Light intensity influences the photo-activation of chlorophyll, and different wavelengths have different effects (green light is reflected)


action spectrum


Enzyme Inhibitors

An enzyme inhibitor is a molecule that disrupts the normal reaction pathway between an enzyme and a substrate

    Enzyme inhibitors can be either competitive or non-competitive depending on their mechanism of action


Inhibition of enzymes may be either reversible or irreversible depending on the specific effect of the inhibitor being used

    Irreversible inhibitors form strong covalent bonds with the enzyme in order to form a permanent attachment
    Reversible inhibitors form weaker, temporary attachments with the enzyme and thus can potentially be dissociated


Competitive Inhibition

    Competitive inhibition involves a molecule, other than the substrate, binding to the enzyme’s active site
    The molecule (inhibitor) is structurally and chemically similar to the substrate (hence able to bind to the active site)
    The competitive inhibitor blocks the active site and thus prevents substrate binding
    As the inhibitor is in competition with the substrate, its effects can be reduced by increasing substrate concentration


competitive inhibition


Non-competitive Inhibition

    Non-competitive inhibition involves a molecule binding to a site other than the active site (an allosteric site)
    The binding of the inhibitor to the allosteric site causes a conformational change to the enzyme’s active site
    As a result of this change, the active site and substrate no longer share specificity, meaning the substrate cannot bind
    As the inhibitor is not in direct competition with the substrate, increasing substrate levels cannot mitigate the inhibitor’s effect

Chloroplasts
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The locations of the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis in C3 plants


Chloroplasts are an organelle in plant cells that convert light energy into chemical energy via the process of photosynthesis

    The chemical energy may be transferred to a molecule that is immediately accessible (ATP) or stored as an organic compound (glucose)
    Only photosynthetic tissues will possess chloroplasts (i.e. they are present within the leaf tissue but are not found in the roots of plants)


Structure

The chloroplast is structured to support the two distinct stages of photosynthesis (the light dependent and light independent stages)

    Chloroplasts contain a series of flattened discs called thylakoids, which are arranged into stacks called grana (increases SA:Vol ratio)
    These membrane discs contain photosynthetic pigments (such as chlorophyll) and are the site of the light dependent reactions
    The internal fluid is called the stroma and contains carbon-fixating enzymes that are responsible for the light independent reactions


Chloroplasts evolved via endosymbiosis and hence retain structural characteristics consistent with an independent prokaryotic origin

    They have a double membrane structure (due to vesicular coating as part of the process of endocytosis)
    They have their own DNA (circular and naked), 70S ribosomes and their metabolic processes are susceptible to certain antibiotics


chloroplast structure


Micrographs

Typically, chloroplast micrographs should display the following features:

    They are usually round in appearance with a double membrane exterior
    The flattened membrane discs (thylakoids) are arranged into stacks (grana), which are connected by lamellae
    The internal lumen of the thylakoids is very small (this allows for a more rapid generation of a proton motive force)
    Ribosomes and chloroplast DNA are usually not visible at standard resolutions and magnifications
    Starch granules may be visible and will appear as dark spots within the chloroplast


Note:  Electron micrographs of a chloroplast may differ in appearance depending on where the cross-section occurs

chloroplast micrograph


Chlorophyll

Photosynthetic pigments function as the main site of light absorption in the light dependent stage of photosynthesis

    Photosynthetic pigments are grouped into photosystems on the thylakoid membrane that absorb and funnel light energy


The main photosynthetic pigment is chlorophyll, which absorbs red and blue light while reflecting green light

    The absorbed light energy functions to energise chlorophyll electrons, which are transferred to an electron transport chain
    Accessory pigments may capture additional wavelengths of light in order to maximise light absorbance by the photosystems

Photosynthesis
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The inputs and outputs of the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis in C3 plants


Photosynthesis involves the synthesis of organic compounds (glucose) from inorganic molecules (CO2 and H2O) in the presence of light

    This process requires a photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll) and can only occur in certain organisms (plants, certain bacteria)


photosynthesis equation


Photosynthesis is a two step process:

    The light dependent reactions convert light energy from the Sun into chemical energy (ATP)
    The light independent reactions use the chemical energy to synthesise organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates)


Light Dependent Reactions

The light dependent reactions occur within the membranous discs called thylakoids (which are arranged into stacks called grana)

    Light is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments (in photosystems), resulting in the release of energised electrons
    The electrons enter an electron transport chain, which results in the production of ATP (via photophosphorylation)
    Light is also absorbed by water, which is split (photolysis) to produce oxygen and hydrogen (carried by NADPH)
    The hydrogen and ATP are used in the light independent reactions, the oxygen is released from stomata as a waste product


light dependent


Light Independent Reactions

The light independent reactions occur within the fluid-filled interior of the chloroplast called the stroma

    ATP and hydrogen (carried by NADPH) are transferred to the site of the light independent reactions
    The hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide to form complex organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates, amino acids, etc.)
    The carbon is fixed by the enzyme Rubisco, with ATP providing the chemical energy required to join the molecules together
    This process is also commonly known as the Calvin cycle


light independent


Extension:  Photophosphorylation

    ATP is produced in the light dependent stage via an electron transport chain, which is located on the thylakoid membrane
    As energised electrons (from chlorophyll) move through the chain, protons use the energy to translocate into the thylakoid lumen
    This creates an electrochemical gradient (or proton motive force) within the thylakoids
    The protons diffuse out of the lumen via a transmembrane enzyme (ATP synthase), which uses this movement to synthesise ATP
    Water replaces electrons lost from chlorophyll, while protons and de-energised electrons (i.e. hydrogen) are transferred to NADPH


Click to play video


Extension:  The Calvin Cycle

    Carbohydrates (glucose, starch) are produced in the light independent stage via the Calvin cycle (in the stroma)
    A 5-C compound called RuBP is combined with carbon dioxide (using the enzyme Rubisco) to form a 6-C compound
    This 6-C compound is unstable and immediately breaks down into 3-C compounds called GP
    The GP is then converted into a triose phosphate (TP) using NADPH and ATP (from the light dependent stage)
    TP can be either used to synthesise carbohydrates or used to regenerate stocks of RuBP

Calvin cycle


Balancing the Calvin Cycle:

The Calvin cycle must occur twice in order to produce a single molecule of glucose (sugar monosaccharide)

    Three molecules of RuBP (5C) are combined with three carbon dioxides to make six molecules of GP (3C)
    All GP molecules are converted into TP via the action of NADPH and ATP (intermediaries from the light dependent reactions)
    One TP is used to make a half-sugar, while the remaining five TP molecules are used to regenerate RuBP (5 × 3C = 3 × 5C)

Plant Adaptations
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The role of Rubisco in photosynthesis, including adaptations of C3, C4 and CAM plants to maximise the efficiency of photosynthesis


The light independent reactions use the enzyme Rubisco to fix carbon (from CO2) in order to make carbohydrates (such as glucose)

    This process (called the Calvin cycle) involves the production of a 3C intermediate called GP (glycerate-3-phosphate)
    As each cycle produces one GP molecule, it takes two cycles to synthesise glucose and more to produce polysaccharides (like starch)


Plants that exclusively fix carbon dioxide this way are called C3 plants – as the initial product (GP) is a 3C compound


Photorespiration

Rubisco can alternatively use oxygen (O2) as a substrate to undergo a different series of reactions known as photorespiration

    Photorespiration creates a product that cannot be used to make sugars and hence reduces the efficiency of the Calvin cycle
    Photorespiration reduces levels of photosynthesis by up to ~25% in C3 plants, reducing energy yield in these plants


photorespiration


C4 and CAM Plants

Because oxygen acts as a competitive inhibitor for Rubisco, photosynthesis in C3 plants is reduced in the presence of oxygen

    C3 plants are less efficient in hot and dry regions, as the stomata must remain closed in order to prevent excessive water loss
    When the stomata are closed, oxygen cannot diffuse out of the leaf, increasing oxygen concentration relative to CO2 levels


In an effort to maximise photosynthesis, some plants have evolved mechanisms to limit the exposure of Rubisco to oxygen

    C4 and CAM plants use an alternate enzyme called PEP carboxylase to initially fix the carbon and make a 4C compound
    PEP carboxylase has a higher affinity for carbon dioxide than Rubisco and doesn’t bind to oxygen at all
    These plants can then store and transfer the 4C compounds to regions with lower oxygen concentrations


C4 Pathway 
In the C4 pathway, carbon dioxide is physically separated from oxygen in order to improve CO2 binding to Rubisco 

    The CO2 is converted to the 4C compound in the mesophyll and then sequestered to a deeper tissue layer where less O2 is present
    In this deeper tissue layer (the bundle sheath), the CO2 is released and can enter the Calvin cycle without competition from oxygen


CAM Pathway

In the CAM pathway, carbon reserves are created at night and then released for use during the day (temporal isolation)

    CAM plants are suited to hot and arid environments where water loss is high and stomata must therefore remain closed during the day
    The CO2 is converted into the 4C compound during the night, when stomata are open and the CO2 is able to diffuse into the leaf
    The stored CO2 is then released for use during the day, when closed stomata would otherwise prevent photosynthesis from proceeding

C3, C4 and CAM

Mitochondria
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The locations of glycolysis, Krebs Cycle and electron transport chain


Mitochondria are the 'power plants’ of the cell – synthesising large amounts of ATP via aerobic respiration

    All eukaryotic cells possess mitochondria – aerobic prokaryotes use the cell membrane to perform oxidative phosphorylation


Structure

The structure of a mitochondrion is adapted to the function it performs:

    The mitochondrion is a double membrane structure with the inner membrane arranged into folds (cristae) to increase the SA:Vol ratio
    The inner membrane contains the electron transport chain and ATP synthase (which is used for oxidative phosphorylation)
    The gap between the membranes (intermembrane space) is very small to maximise the gradient upon proton accumulation
    The internal fluid is called the matrix and contains the enzymes responsible for the Krebs cycle


Mitochondria evolved via endosymbiosis and hence retain structural characteristics consistent with an independent prokaryotic origin

    They have a double membrane structure (due to vesicular coating as part of the process of endocytosis)
    They have their own DNA (circular and naked), 70S ribosomes and their metabolic processes are susceptible to certain antibiotics


mitochondrion


Micrographs

Typically, mitochondrial diagrams should display the following features:

    Usually sausage-shaped in appearance (though will appear more rounded in perpendicular cross-sections)
    Inner membrane contains many internal protrusions (cristae)
    Intermembrane space is very small (allows for a more rapid generation of a proton motive force)
    Ribosomes and mitochondrial DNA are usually not visible at standard resolutions and magnifications


Note:  Electron micrographs of a mitochondrion may differ in appearance depending on where the cross-section occurs

Cell Respiration
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The main inputs, outputs and locations of glycolysis, Krebs Cycle and electron transport chain including ATP yield


Cell respiration is the controlled release of energy from the breakdown of organic compounds (principally glucose) 

    Glucose can be partially broken down under anaerobic conditions (no oxygen) within the cytosol for a low energy yield
    The partially digested products can be completely broken down under aerobic conditions (oxygen) in mitochondria for a higher yield


ATP Production

When organic compounds are broken down, the energy released is transferred to one of two coenzyme molecules

    ATP is the primary energy carrier and can be produced directly from ADP (and Pi) via substrate-level phosphorylation
    Hydrogen carriers act as a transitional energy carrier and can transfer energy to form ATP via oxidative phosphorylation
        Oxidative phosphorylation involves an electron transport chain located on the inner membrane (cristae) of the mitochondria
        Oxidative phosphorylation requires oxygen to function, hence only aerobic respiration can produce ATP from hydrogen carriers


ATP production


Anaerobic Respiration

Anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen and involves the partial breakdown of glucose via the process of glycolysis 

    It occurs in the cytosol and results in a low yield of ATP (net 2 molecules total) via substrate level phosphorylation


anaerobic equation


Glycolysis

    In glycolysis, glucose is broken down within the cytosol into two 3C-compounds called pyruvate (or pyruvic acid)
    This process uses two molecules of ATP but produces four molecules (for an overall net gain of 2 ATP molecules)
    Hydrogen atoms are also removed (via oxidation) and transferred to unloaded coenzymes (NAD)
    This results in a small yield of loaded hydrogen carriers (NADH) which can be used by the mitochondria


glycolysis


Aerobic Respiration

Aerobic respiration involves the complete breakdown of glucose in the mitochondria for a higher ATP yield (net 30 or 32 ATP)

    It is preceded by the anaerobic breakdown of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (via glycolysis in the cytosol) 
    It occurs across two key stages: the Krebs cycle (in the matrix) and the electron transport chain (on the inner membrane)


new aerobic equation


Krebs Cycle

    The pyruvate produced via glycolysis is transferred to the mitochondrial matrix and oxidised to form acetyl coenzyme A
    Acetyl CoA is then introduced into the Krebs cycle, where it is combined with a 4C compound to make a 6C intermediate
    This 6C intermediate (citrate) is broken down into the original 4C compound over a series of sequential chemical reactions
    These reactions result in the formation of one ATP per pyruvate (2 in total) and a large number of loaded hydrogen carriers
    The breakdown of pyruvate also results in the formation of carbon dioxide (3 molecules per pyruvate, for 6 molecules in total)


krebs cycle


Electron Transport Chain

    Hydrogen carriers (NADH and FADH2) donate energised electrons (and protons) to an electron transport chain on the cristae
    The electron transport chain utilises the energy stored in the donated electrons to make ATP via oxidative phosphorylation
    A total of 26 or 28 molecules of ATP are produced as a result of the unloading of hydrogen carriers within the mitochondria
    For the electron transport chain to continue to function, the donated electrons (and protons) must be removed from the chain
    Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor in the transport chain and is complexed with the protons to form water molecules 


ETC


Extension:  Chemiosmosis

    ATP is produced by the electron transport chain via the oxidation of hydrogen carriers (hence via oxidative phosphorylation)
    When hydrogen carriers (NADH or FADH2) are oxidised, they release high energy electrons and protons (i.e. hydrogen)
    The electrons are transferred to a transport chain consisting of several transmembrane protein carriers
    As electrons pass through the chain, they lose energy – which is used by the chain to pump the protons from the matrix
    The accumulation of protons within the intermembrane space creates an electrochemical gradient (or a proton motive force)
    The proton motive force will cause the protons to move down their electrochemical gradient and diffuse back into matrix
    This diffusion of protons is called chemiosmosis and is facilitated by the transmembrane enzyme ATP synthase
    As the protons move through ATP synthase they trigger the molecular rotation of the enzyme, synthesising ATP
    The protons and de-energised electrons are coupled to oxygen to form water – if oxygen is not present to act as the final electron acceptor then the electron transport chain will be unable to continue functioning (hence, this process is aerobic)



Overview of Aerobic Respiration

Aerobic respiration requires oxygen and uses the mitochondria to produce a large yield of ATP (compared to anaerobic)

    Glycolysis produces net 2 ATP (via substrate level phosphorylation) and a small quantity of hydrogen carriers (2 NADH)
    Krebs cycle produces 2 ATP (via substrate level phosphorylation) and a large quantity of hydrogen carriers (8 NADH + 2 FADH2)
    The electron transport chain uses the hydrogen carriers to produce 26 or 28 ATP via oxidative phosphorylation (requires oxygen)

Fermentation
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The location, inputs and the difference in outputs of anaerobic fermentation in animals and yeasts

    Uses and applications of anaerobic fermentation of biomass for biofuel production


The anaerobic breakdown of glucose into pyruvate (via glycolysis) results in the production of a small amount of hydrogen carrier (NADH)

    In the presence of oxygen, this hydrogen carrier will be oxidised as part of the electron transport chain (i.e. becomes unloaded NAD)
    In the absence of oxygen, the carrier cannot be oxidised by mitochondria and stocks of the unloaded coenzyme will become depleted


Fermentation

Fermentation involves the conversion of pyruvate into an alternative carbon compound via a reaction that oxidises the hydrogen carrier

    This restores the stocks of unloaded coenzyme needed for glycolysis, allowing ATP production to continue in the absence of oxygen
    Fermentation is therefore considered to be a vital component of anaerobic respiration, as glycolysis could not otherwise be sustained


The products of fermentation differ between animals and plants or yeast:

    In animals, pyruvate is converted into lactic acid (lactate) – this reaction is reversible (pyruvate can be reformed when oxygen is present)
    In plants or yeast, pyruvate is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide – this reaction is irreversible (the pyruvate cannot be reformed)


fermentation


Anaerobic fermentation has many practical applications:

    In animals, fermentation is used to maximise the power of muscle contractions (allows energy capacity to exceed oxygen levels)
    In yeasts, fermentation is used in the production of alcoholic beverages and allows for dough to rise (leavening) when baking 


Biofuels

Biofuels are an energy source produced from the anaerobic fermentation of biomass (organic material from plants and animals)

    Whereas fossil fuels are non-renewable as they form via exceedingly slow geological processes (over several million years), biofuels are derived from rapid biological processes and are therefore functionally renewable (provided there is a constant stock of reagents)
    Because the biomass is typically derived from the anabolic conversion of inorganic sources of carbon (i.e. carbon dioxide), there is a lower carbon footprint associated with its production (making it arguably better for the environment)


Biofuel production involves the growth of anaerobic microbes in an enclosed and sterilised vessel called a fermenter

    When provided with a source of biomass, the microbes will anerobically ferment this organic feedstock to produce the biofuel
    The fermenter distributes materials evenly within the chamber and controls the temperature, pH, levels of nutrients and wastes 
    The biofuel can be collected from the fermenter after a fixed amount of time (batch cultivation) or ongoing (continuous cultivation)


The biomass used to produce biofuels (via anaerobic fermentation) can be sourced in a number of different ways:

    It can be produced from agricultural feedstocks (i.e. edible crops), however this requires the use of large amounts of arable land to produce the feedstock and can potentially drive up regional food costs (as less crops are being used as a traditional food source) 
    It can also be produced from non-edible plant components and certain municipal wastes, however these have higher production costs 


Algae is an alternative biomass source for anaerobic fermentation that does not require arable land and can operate at low costs 

    Algae can photosynthesise and hence produce a stock of biomass (starch, glucose, cellulose) within contained photobioreactors


biofuel


Bioethanol is a common biofuel that is used to supplement or replace traditional fossil fuels (e.g. gasoline) in fuel tanks

    Drawbacks of bioethanol include the fact that it has a lower energy content than fossil fuels, is harder to vaporise (so may be more difficult to use in colder temperatures) and is more likely to corrode materials (such as car engines) upon extended exposure
