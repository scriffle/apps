Key Knowledge:

    Initiation of an immune response, including antigen presentation, the distinction between self-antigens and non-self antigens, cellular and non-cellular pathogens and allergens


A disease is a condition that disturbs the normal physiology of the body, leading to a deterioration in the state of health (illness)

    An infectious disease is caused by a transmissible agent called a pathogen that disrupts the body's homeostatic processes


Pathogens

A pathogen is a disease-causing agent that can either be cellular (living) or non-cellular (non-living)

    Examples of cellular pathogens include parasites, protozoa or bacteria, while non-cellular pathogens include viruses and prions


pathogens


Non-Cellular Pathogens

Non-cellular pathogens cannot reproduce independently and spread infection via protein isoforms (prions) or via nucleic acids (viruses)

Viruses

    Viruses are submicroscopic agents that commandeer cells to rapidly propagate new virus particles (virions), preventing homeostasis
    Viruses are metabolically inert and are incapable of reproducing independently of a host cell (hence are non-living)
    They typically consist of an inner core of nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat (capsid)
    Simpler viruses may lack a capsid (viroids), whilst more complex viruses may possess an external lipid envelope
    Viruses can be either DNA-based adenoviruses or RNA-based retroviruses (which require reverse transcriptase to make DNA)
    Viruses can integrate into a host genome and remain dormant for a period while the infected cell replicates (lysogenic cycle)
    Viruses may also destroy the host cell in order to spread new virus particles (lytic cycle)


Prions

    A prion is an infectious protein that has folded abnormally into a structure capable of causing disease
    Prions can cause normally folded proteins to refold into the abnormal form and hence propagate within a host body
    Prion proteins aggregate together to form amyloid fibres that cause holes to form in the brain (spongiform encephalopathy)
    Infectious prion proteins have a higher beta-sheet content, making them more resistant to denaturation and difficult to treat


non-cellular pathogens


Cellular Pathogens

Cellular pathogens function as parasites – growing and feeding on another organism without contributing to the survival of the host

    They can either live on the surface of a host (e.g. moulds, arthropods) or within the host tissue (e.g. bacteria, protozoa, helminths)


Fungi

    Fungi usually colonise body surfaces (skin or mucous membranes) and can be unicellular (yeasts) or multicellular (moulds)
    Moulds consist of filaments called hyphae, which may trigger disease by forming a mass of invading threads called mycelium
    Examples of fungal infections include thrush (yeast infection) and athlete’s foot (mould infection)


Bacteria

    Bacteria are unicellular prokaryotic cells that can reproduce quickly and compete with host cells for space and nutrition
    Most bacteria are relatively harmless and some may even form mutualistic relationships with hosts (e.g. normal gut flora)
    Bacteria may cause disease by producing toxic compounds (exotoxins) or releasing the substances when destroyed (endotoxins)
    As the toxins retain their destructive capacity beyond bacterial death, they are often the cause of food poisoning


Other Examples

    Ectoparasites live on the surface of a host and may cause disease in humans either directly or indirectly
        Arthropods (lice, ticks and mites) feed on the blood and may directly cause disease by injecting substances that act as toxins
        Insects (fleas and mosquitoes) may not have an inherently harmful bite but may indirectly cause disease by acting as a vector
    Endoparasites live within hosts and include microparasites (e.g. unicellular protozoa) or macroparasites (e.g. multicellular helminths)
        Examples of protozoa which cause disease include Plasmodia (malaria) and Trypanosoma (African sleeping sickness)
        Examples of helminth which cause disease include roundworm, tapeworm and flatworm (note: 'ringworm' is a fungal infection)


cellular pathogens


Pathogen Identification

Most multicellular organisms possess some form of intrinsic immune system to allow them to respond to pathogenic infections

    The immune system can differentiate betwen foreign (non-self) and native (self) cells due to the presence of identification markers


Self Markers

All nucleated cells in the human body possess distinctive surface molecules that serve to identify the cells as part of the host (self)

    These self markers are called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and are unique to the host organism
    The immune system will not normally react to cells bearing these genetically determined markers (i.e. self tolerance)
    As these markers are unique to the host, the MHC molecules from different organisms will initiate an immune response
    Closely related individuals will have genetically similar markers and be less likely to reject donor tissue from organ transplants


Red blood cells are not nucleated and hence do not possess MHC markers (so can potentially be transferred without rejection)

    Red blood cells do possess basic selection markers (the ABO blood system) which limit the capacity for universal transfusions 
    Only individuals that possess a common or compatible blood group will be able to exchange blood without immune rejection


self markers


Antigens

Pathogens will possess certain common molecular markers that the immune system can recognise and respond to non-specifically

    These molecular characteristics are called pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate an innate immune response


Pathogens additionally possess distinctive molecular fragments that the immune system can recognise and respond to specifically

    These particular substances that are recognised as foreign and elicit a specific immune response are called antigens


Antigens are recognised based on the characteristic shape of an exposed portion of the molecule called the epitope

    The immune system produces specific antibodies that bind to the epitope via a complementary paratope (antigen binding site)
    Antibodies are a class of proteins (called immunoglobulins) that neutralise pathogens by targeting their antigenic determinants


antigen


Allergens

An allergen is an environmental substance that triggers an immune response despite not being intrinsically harmful

    This immune response tends to be localised to the region of exposure (e.g. airways and throat) as an allergic reaction
    A severe systemic allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis and can be fatal if left untreated 


An allergic reaction requires a pre-sensitised immune state (i.e. prior exposure to the allergen)

    Upon initial exposure to an allergen, specific antibodies (IgE) are produced that attach to particular immune cells (mast cells)
    The antibodies effectively ‘prime’ the immune system towards the allergen, resulting in a hypersensitive response upon re-exposure
    IgE-primed mast cells trigger an allergic reaction by releasing large amounts of histamine which causes inflammation


allergic reaction

Surface Barriers
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    Physical, chemical and microbiota barriers as preventative mechanisms of pathogenic infection in animals and plants


The first line of defence against infectious disease are the surface barriers that prevent the entry of pathogens into the body

    These preventative mechanisms of pathogenic infection can be categorised as either physical, chemical or microbiota barriers


Physical Barriers

Physical barriers form an external surface that protects the internal structures from the surrounding environment 

    Intact skin consists of a dry and thick outer layer composed predominantly of dead cells that prevent external infection
    Mucous membranes consists of a thin region of living surface cells that function to protect internal structures (i.e. cavities and tubes)
        Mucous membranes may be ciliated (e.g. airways) to assist in the trapping and subsequent removal of pathogens
        They can release fluids (tears, mucus) to help wash away pathogens and are supported by physical actions (sneezing, coughing)


Chemical Barriers

Chemical barriers consist of biochemical agents which inhibit the growth and spread of pathogens on external or internal surfaces

    Sebaceous glands secrete chemicals (such as fatty acids and lactic acid) which inhibit microbial growth on the surface of the skin
    Tears and saliva contain lysozyme (enzyme) which can destroy cell walls, while sticky mucins (in mucus) help to clear pathogens
    The stomach and genitourinary tracts both produce acids in order to create a hostile pH range to pathogens in these regions


Microbiota Barriers

Microbiotic barriers consist of the normal flora (commensals) that line specific cavities (such as the digestive tract) in most animals

    By occupying the available space in the intestines, the microbiota prevents the colonisation of these surfaces by pathogenic cells


surface barriers


Plant Barriers

Plants lack cellular defences (unlike animals) and so rely solely on structural and biochemical defences against pathogens

    The thick, waxy cuticle and outer epidermal cells provide a physical barrier for plants in the same way that skin does in animals
    Plants may employ certain structures, including thorns, to deter animals (and hence avoid potential vector-based pathogens)
    When pathogens invade the vascular tissue, layers of thickened cells form and create protuberances (galls) to limit the spread
    Some plants resist disease by producing chemicals (stored in vacuoles) that have antimicrobial properties (e.g. saponins)
    Plants may additionally secrete a range of other anti-bacterial or anti-fungal agents, including resins, tannins and defensins
    Some trees will produce particular oils that repel certain insect pests (and any associated vector-borne diseases)
    Additionally, certain plants may secrete gum around infected areas, essentially sealing the area off prior to abscission (shedding)

Leukocytes
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The characteristics and roles of macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, natural killer cells and mast cells


Once a pathogen has evaded the surface barriers comprising the first line of defence, it is challenged by white blood cells (leukocytes)

    There are three main types of white blood cells that function within the human body – granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes


leukocytes


Innate Immune Cells

Leukocytes that function non-specifically to remove pathogens from the host body are considered part of the innate immune system

    These cells include neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells / basophils, monocytes (macrophages / dendritic cells) and NK cells


Neutrophils

    Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell and the first responder to microbial infection
    They are very short-lived and have a circulating life span of less than a day (forms the majority of pus)
    Neutrophils destroy pathogens via phagocytosis but are not involved in subsequent antigen presentation
    Analogy:  Standard police officer – quick to respond to the situation, but lacks special training or skills and so dies rapidly


Eosinophils

    Prominent at the sites of allergic reactions and parasitic infections (rare in blood but common at mucous membranes)
    Do not phagocytose pathogens but instead release chemical products which perforate cell membranes
    Consequently, they function as the primary response to large multicellular parasites (e.g. helminth infections)
    Analogy:  Fumigator – specialised to deal with pests / parasites (e.g. helminths) by releasing chemical products


Mast Cells / Basophils

    These cells are chiefly responsible for initiating inflammatory responses by releasing the chemicals histamine and heparin
    Mast cells and basophils are functionally similar, however mast cells are localised while basophils circulate in the blood
    Because they promote inflammation, they are common contributors to allergic responses
    Analogy:  Fireman – the leukocyte involved when a region is inflamed (‘in flames’)


Monocytes

    Monocytes are the largest type of leukocyte and share phagocytosis duties with neutrophils
    They are slower to respond than neutrophils but are longer lasting, as they can renew their lysosomes for continued digestion
    The are responsible for antigen presentation (to lymphocytes) and serve as a link between the innate and adaptive systems
    Monocytes will differentiate into two types of cells in response to pathogenic infection – macrophages and dendritic cells
    Macrophages typically remain in the tissue and phagocytose, whereas dendritic cells are better suited to antigen presentation
    Analogy:  Riot police – slower to respond than standard police but better prepared and survives for longer


Natural Killer (NK) Cells

    Natural killer cells function to target and destroy virally infected or cancerous body cells (i.e. they target ’self’ tissue)
    They are a type of lymphocyte and have a comparable role to cytotoxic T cells, except that they are non-specific in function
    NK cells are recruited to sites of infection when the infected cells release a specific chemical agent (cytokine) called interferon
    Analogy:  Bomb disposal technician – functions to remove suspicious or compromised cells from within the body


Adaptive Immune Cells

Leukocytes that function specifically to remove pathogens from the host body are considered part of the adaptive immune system

    These cells include both B and T lymphocytes (TH and TC cells), but do not include natural killer cells (which are non-specific)


Lymphocytes

    These cells are more common in the lymphatic system than blood and are slowest to respond (requiring antigen presentation)
    Helper T cells (TH cells) release chemical agents called cytokines to stimulate an antigen-specific B lymphocyte to form clones
    B lymphocytes divide and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells to destroy extracellular pathogens (humoral immunity)
    Cytotoxic T cells (TC cells) specifically target intracellular pathogens – virally infected or cancerous cells (cell-mediated immunity)
    Analogy:  Special forces troops – takes longest to mobilise but specially trained to target specific pathogens

Innate Immunity
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The innate immune response including the steps in an inflammatory response, complement proteins and interferons


The second line of defence against infectious disease is the innate immune system, which has two key qualities:

    It is non-specific (cannot differentiate between specific microorganisms)
    It is non-adaptive (produces the same response every time - in other words, it does not possess memory)


Innate immune components include phagocytes, inflammation, complement proteins, cytokines, NK cells, clotting and fever

Phagocytic Leukocytes

Phagocytosis is the process by which solid materials (i.e. pathogens) are ingested by a white blood cell (leukocyte)

    Phagocytic leukocytes circulate in the blood and move into the body tissue (extravasation) in response to infection
    Damaged tissues release chemicals (chemokines) which draw white blood cells to the site of infection (via chemotaxis)
    Pathogens are engulfed when cellular extensions (pseudopodia) surround the pathogen and then fuse to form an internal vesicle
    The vesicle is then fused to a lysosome (forming a phagolysosome) and the pathogen is digested


Types of phagocytic leukocytes include neutrophils and monocytes (macrophages and dendritic cells)

    Neutrophils are the initial responders to a pathogen infection but have a very short circulating life span
    Monocytes are longer lasting and can affix antigenic fragments onto their surface (becoming antigen presenting cells)


phagocytosis


Inflammation

The inflammatory response functions as a mechanism to increase the migration of white blood cells to the site of an infection

    When tissue damage occurs, mast cells (localised) and basophils (circulating) release a chemical called histamine
    Histamine causes local vasodilation and increases capillary permeability to improve the recruitment of leukocytes to the region
    Damaged cells also release chemotactic factors which attract leukocytes to the site of infection
    While inflammation is necessary to allow immune cells access to damaged tissue, there are unavoidable side effects
    Increased blood flow causes redness and heat, while increased permeability releases fluids and causes swelling and tenderness
    Inflammation can be either short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic)


inflammation


Complement Proteins

Complement proteins are synthesised by the liver and enhance (complement) the ability of phagocytes to clear pathogenic microbes

    These proteins are normally inactive in the blood, but in response to immune activation initiate a cascade that help protect the body


Activation of the complement system may provide protection against pathogenic microbes in the following ways:

    May form a membrane attack complex (MAC) that perforates the plasma membranes of bacterial cells
    May assist in the recruitment of white blood cells to the site of infection (via chemotaxis)
    May coat pathogenic microbes and aid in their identification by phagocytic leukocytes (opsonization)


Cytokines

Cytokines are signalling proteins that regulate communication within the immune system (they act as immunomodulatory agents)

    They are chemical messengers that regulate the activity of immune cells (e.g. chemokines, interleukins, tumor necrosis factors)


Interferons are a specific type of cytokine that provide protection against virally-infected cells and cancer cells

    Infected cells release interferons to alert surrounding cells and reduce their susceptibility to infection (by activating antiviral agents)
    Interferons will also recruit natural killer cells (NK cells) which non-specifically target and destroy virally-infected cells or cancers
    Upon activation, natural killer cells release perforating chemicals (perforins and granzymes) which trigger the lysis of the target cell


Clotting

Clotting is a mechanism that repairs broken blood vessels to limit pathogenic access to the bloodstream when the skin is broken

    Damaged cells release clotting factors which cause platelets to become sticky and adhere to the damaged region (forming a plug)
    Clotting factors also trigger a coagulation cascade that results in the conversion of a soluble plasma protein into an insoluble form (fibrin)
    The insoluble fibrin strands form a mesh of fibres around the platelet plug and traps blood cells to form a temporary clot


clotting


Fever

A fever is an abnormally high body temperature that is associated with an infection and is triggered by the release of prostaglandins

    Fever may help to combat infection by reducing the growth rate of pathogens (via the inactivation of enzymes required by the invader)
    It may also increase metabolic activity of body cells and activate heat shock proteins in order to strengthen the overall immune response
    Up to a certain point fever may be beneficial, but beyond a tolerable limit it can cause damage to a body's own enzymes

Lymphatic System
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The role of the lymphatic system in the immune response as a transport network and the role of lymph nodes as sites for antigen recognition by T and B lymphocytes


The lymphatic system is an interconnected network of lymphatic vessels that function as a transport network for the immune response

    Phagocytic leukocytes are transported within the blood to sites of infection (recruited by chemotactic factors released from local cells)
    Monocytes will engulf the pathogens and present antigenic fragments on their surface (becoming antigen presenting cells)
    The antigen presenting cells then drain from the blood and tissues into the lymphatic system, forming a clear fluid called lymph
    The lymphatic system contains a series of filtration points (lymph nodes) that contain high amounts of lymphocytes (in lobules)
    The antigen presenting cells facilitate antigen recognition by specific T and B lymphocytes, triggering an adaptive immune response
    The filtered lymph is then returned to venous circulation (the lymphatic system uses valves to ensure the one-way movement of fluid)


Primary Lymphoid Organs

The primary lymphoid organs consist of the bone marrow and thymus, whose collective function is to produce mature lymphocytes

    The bone marrow is the site of all blood cell production (it contains multipotent hematopoietic stem cells)
    The thymus is responsible for the maturation and development of functional T lymphocytes (needed for antigen recognition)


T lymphocytes undergo both positive and negative selection in the thymus to ensure they can initiate an adaptive immune response

    Negative selection:  T cells that react to the body’s own proteins (i.e. self antigens) are destroyed (to prevent autoimmunity)
    Positive selection:  Only T cells that interact with MHC markers are selected (MHC markers present the foreign antigenic fragments)


thymus selection


Secondary Lymphoid Organs

The secondary lymphoid organs include the spleen and lymph nodes, whose collective function is initiate an adaptive immune response

    The spleen stores excess quantities of leukocytes (particularly monocytes), allowing for a more rapid response to pathogenic infection
    The lymph nodes contain high levels of lymphocytes and act as a filtration point where antigen presentation by monocytes can occur


Lymph nodes contain multiple compartments called lobules (or nodules) that are rich in immature (or inactive) B and T lymphocytes

    Antigen presenting cells within the lymph are transported to these lobules in order to interact with, and activate, the lymphocytes


lymph node


The lymphatic system functions as a point of connection between the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response

    It is where the antigen presenting cells (innate system) display specific antigens to the B and T lymphocytes (adaptive system)
    In addition to its immune function, the lymphatic system also absorbs excess tissue fluid and transports fats from the small intestine

Adaptive Immunity
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The characteristics and roles of the components of the adaptive immune response against both extracellular and intracellular threats, including the actions of B lymphocytes and their antibodies, helper T and cytotoxic T cells


The third line of defence against infectious disease is the adaptive immune system, which has two key qualities:

    It is specific (it can differentiate between specific microorganisms and respond accordingly)
    It is adaptive (it can produce a heightened response upon re-exposure - in other words, it has memory)


The adaptive immune system is slower to mobilise (compared to innate responses) and requires the activation of B and T lymphocytes

Antigen Presentation

The adaptive immune system becomes activated when specific pathogen fragments called antigens are presented to the lymphocytes

    T Lymphocytes cannot independently recognise antigens – they need to be introduced to the fragments by antigen presenting cells
    The antigenic fragment is complexed to an identification marker called an MHC molecule (major histocompatability complex molecule)
    There are two main types of MHC markers involved in antigen presentation (denoted as either class I markers or class II markers)


Class I markers are present on all nucleated body cells, allowing any cell that is compromised to act as an ‘amateur' presenting cell

    Class I markers present endogenous antigens (found internally) to cytotoxic T cells, which initiate a cell-mediated immune response
    When an antigen is presented on a class I marker, the presenting cell will be destroyed (as it contains an intracellular threat)


Class II markers are only present on ‘professional' antigen presenting cells (monocytes) that engulf foreign pathogens via phagocytosis 

    Class II markers present exogenous antigens (found externally) to helper T cells, which initiate a humoral immune response
    When an antigen is presented on a class II marker, the presenting cell is not destroyed (as the identified threat is extracellular)


MHC


Clonal Selection

The body contains millions of different lymphocytes that each recognise a single, particular antigen (the adaptive immunity is specific)

    Specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are activated when antigens are presented on MHC class I markers (cell-mediated immunity)
    Specific helper T lymphocytes are activated when antigens are presented on MHC class II markers (humoral immunity)


Only one specific lymphocyte can be activated by a particular antigenic fragment to divide and form copies (clonal selection / expansion)

    However, a pathogen may contain multiple antigen fragments and hence activate multiple specific lymphocytes (polyclonal activation)


clonal selection



Cell Mediated Immunity

Cell-mediated immunity uses cytotoxic T cells to target endogenous antigens (i.e. intracellular pathogenic threats)

    Cancerous and virus-infected cells are not recognised as foreign and hence cannot be specifically targeted by antibodies
    These compromised cells present their antigenic fragments as a complex with their own self markers (MHC class I)
    Cytotoxic T cells can recognise these specific antigens and will release perforating enzymes when stimulated
    These enzymes cause the infected / cancerous cell to by lysed, preventing the further spread of infection
    NK cells function in a similar manner, but are non-specific (they respond to interferon secretion, not antigen presentation)


cell mediated


Humoral Immunity

Humoral immunity describes the pathway by which antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes to target exogenous antigens

    When monocytes engulf extracellular pathogens, they digest them within lysosomes to release antigenic fragments
    These fragments are presented on special surface receptors (MHC class II) that denote the material as being foreign
    The antigens are presented to helper T cells, which in turn secrete cytokines to activate the appropriate B lymphocyte
    Each B lymphocyte has a specific antibody on its surface that is capable of recognising a single specific antigen
    The appropriate B lymphocyte will divide and differentiate (via clonal selection) to form antibody-producing plasma cells
    The plasma cells are short-lived, but will mass produce the antigen-specific antibody for the duration of its circulating life span


humoral


Antibodies

An antibody (or immunoglobulin) is a protein produced by B lymphocytes (and plasma cells) that is specific to a given antigen

    Antibodies are made of 4 polypeptide chains that are joined together by disulphide bonds to form Y-shaped molecules
    The ends of the arms are where the antigen binds – these areas are called the variable regions and differ between antibodies
    The rest of the molecule is constant across all antibodies and serves as a recognition site for the immune system (opsonisation)
    Each type of antibody recognises a unique antigen, making antigen-antibody interactions specific (and part of adaptive immunity)


Antibody specificity is determined by the recombination of antibody genes in B lymphocytes (specifically the VDJ gene segments)

    Each B lymphocyte creates an antibody with a different variable region according to how the antibody genes are recombined
    Over 100 million specific antibodies are created by the body before an antigenic fragment has even been encountered


antibody structure


Antibodies aid in the destruction of pathogens by a number of different mechanisms:

    Precipitation – Antibody binding can cause soluble pathogens to become insoluble within the tissue fluid (precipitation)
    Agglutination – Antibodies can cause multiple pathogens to clump together, facilitating easier removal of the pathogens
    Neutralisation – Antibodies may occlude pathogenic regions, preventing the pathogen from binding to its target
    Inflammation – Antibodies may bind to mast cells, triggering an enhanced inflammatory response within the body
    Complement activation – Antibodies can trigger the activation of complement proteins (which can cause pathogen lysis)


Collectively, antibodies enhance the immune system by aiding the detection and removal of pathogens by phagocytic leukocytes 

    The constant region of antibodies can be recognised by monocytes, improving pathogen identification (via opsonisation)
    The monocytes (principally macrophages) can now engulf and eliminate pathogens more efficiently, reducing disease symptoms


antibody function


Immunological Memory

The adaptive immune system relies on the clonal expansion of B lymphocytes to produce sufficiently large numbers of antibodies

    This means there is a delay between the initial exposure to a pathogen and the production of large quantities of antibodies
    If pathogens can reproduce rapidly during this delay period, they can impede normal body functioning and cause disease


Memory cells are produced to prevent this delay in subsequent exposures and hence prevent disease symptoms developing

    When a B lymphocyte is activated and undergoes clonal expansion, a small proportion will differentiate into memory cells
    Memory B cells are long living and will survive in the body for many years, producing low levels of circulating antibodies
    If a second infection with the same pathogen occurs, memory B cells will react more vigorously to produce antibodies faster
    As antibodies are produced faster, the pathogen cannot reproduce in sufficient amounts to cause disease symptoms
    Hence, because pathogen exposure no longer causes the disease to occur, the individual is said to be immune
    Helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells also produce memory cells to aid in the development of ongoing immunity

Types of Immunity
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The difference between natural and artificial immunity and active and passive strategies for acquiring immunity


Immunity can be described as either active or passive, depending on how it is acquired:

    Active immunity involves the production of antibodies by the body itself and the subsequent development of memory cells
    Passive immunity results from the acquisition of antibodies from another source and hence memory cells are not developed


Active versus Passive Immunity

Active immunity will result in long-term immunity but passive immunity will not (due to the presence or absence of memory cells) 

    Both active and passive immunity can be induced by either natural or artificial mechanisms


Types of Active Immunity

    Natural – Producing antibodies in response to exposure to a pathogenic infection (i.e. challenge and response)
    Artificial – Producing antibodies in response to the controlled exposure to an attenuated pathogen (i.e. vaccination) 


Types of Passive Immunity

    Natural – Receiving antibodies from another organism (e.g. to the newborn via the delivery of breast milk)
    Artificial – Receiving manufactured antibodies via external delivery (e.g blood transfusions of monoclonal antibodies)
