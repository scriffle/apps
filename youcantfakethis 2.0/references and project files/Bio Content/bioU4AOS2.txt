Disease Spread

Key Knowledge:

    The emergence of new pathogens and re-emergence of known pathogens in a globally connected world, including the impact of European arrival on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples

    Consequences of bacterial resistance and viral antigenic drift and shift in terms of ongoing challenges for treatment strategies and vaccination against pathogens


An outbreak is a sudden rise in the occurrence of an infectious disease (as measured by the number of cases)

    An outbreak that occurs over a given time period within a particular community or geographic region is called an epidemic
    An outbreak that occurs across a wider geographical area (e.g. intercontinental or global spread) is called a pandemic


Outbreaks occur when a pathogen is introduced into a community that has no immunity against it – this spread may be driven by:

    The globalisation of travel and trade (enables the transmission of pathogens between otherwise segregated communities)
    Deforestation (habitat reduction forces wildlife into closer proximity to humans, increasing exposure to zoonotic pathogens)
    Climate change (alters the breeding cycles and geographic distribution of biological vectors such as rodents and mosquitos)


Historical Outbreak: Australia

European settlement in Australia resulted in a wave of epidemic diseases which annihilated many Indigenous communities

    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had no prior exposure to diseases such as smallpox, measles and influenza
    This meant that indigenous populations lacked suitable immunity and suffered higher mortality rates from these diseases


European colonisation also impacted the normal behaviours of indigenous populations, leading to higher risks of infection:

    The appropriation of land by the British restricted the Aboriginal peoples' capacity to access traditional food sources
    This led to the abandonment of a nomadic lifestyle and the establishment of permanent camps (increasing exposure to germs)
    These permanent camps lacked suitable sanitation and the changes to diet increased the levels of malnutrition in the community
    The adoption of European dress also increased disease spread as Aborigines had no tradition of washing clothes (or access to soap)


One example of an infectious disease that decimated Aboriginal clans following European settlement was smallpox

    It has been estimated that roughly 50 – 70% of the Aboriginal population in the Sydney area died within two years of British arrival


Emergence of New Pathogens

New strains of pathogens can emerge within a community if pre-existing pathogens alter their structure to develop new antigenicity

    In viruses, this emergence can occur gradually as a result of antigenic drift or suddenly as a result of antigenic shift


Antigenic Drift

    Antigenic drift occurs when the accumulation of point mutations lead to a gradual change in the surface proteins of the virus
    Consequently, antibodies produced against the original virus may no longer be able to recognise the new viral strain
    Antigenic drift can lead to seasonal reoccurrences of a virus and require new vaccinations (booster shots) to confer protection


Antigenic Shift

    Antigenic shift occurs when cells get infected with multiple viral strains and the gene segments from the two strains get reassorted
    This results in a sudden dramatic change in antigenicity and a new viral sub-type is formed to which an entire population is susceptible
    Antigenic shift can result in new viral sub-types that may cross species barriers and lead to massive outbreaks (i.e. pandemics)


antigenic variation


Re-emergence of Known Pathogens

Bacterial pathogens are commonly treated with antibiotics – chemicals that specifically target prokaryotic cell features

    Broad spectrum antibiotics effectively target many types of bacteria, while narrow spectrum antibiotics are more specific
    The use of broad spectrum antibiotics has led to the re-emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are hard to treat


In a bacterial colony, over many generations, a small proportion of bacteria may develop antibiotic resistance via gene mutation

    When treated with antibiotics, the resistant bacteria will survive and reproduce by binary fission (asexual reproduction)
    The antibiotic resistant bacteria will flourish in the absence of competition from susceptible strains of bacteria (killed by antibiotic)
    Antibiotic resistant bacteria may also confer resistance to susceptible strains by transferring plasmids via bacterial conjugation
    An example of this can be seen in the development of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA or Golden staph)

Disease Control
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    Scientific and social strategies employed to identify and control the spread of pathogens, including identification of the pathogen and host, modes of transmission and measures to control transmission


Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of diseases, as well as applications for controlling their spread

    Controlling disease spread requires the identification of the pathogen and an understanding of the mode of transmission


Pathogen Identification

Infectious pathogens can be identified in host organisms using a variety of biotechnological techniques

    Screening tests identify whether asymptomatic individuals (not showing symptoms) are at a high risk of being infectious 
    Diagnostic tests provide a conclusive and definitive determination of the presence or absence of a disease in an individual


pathogen identification


PCR Analysis

    A diagnostic technique that involves the use of fluorescent primers that are specific to viral sequences
    Amplification of the fluorescently tagged viral sequences (in a saliva sample) indicates infection in the host


Blood Cultures

    A diagnostic technique that involves growing and then identifying cultures of a pathogenic microbe from a blood sample
    Blood tests can also identify the presence of specific antibodies, but this is a screening technique (may be a past infection)


Western Blotting*

    A screening technique in which gel electrophoresis is used to isolate antigens that are specific to a given pathogen
    The isolated antigens are transferred to a membrane that is then stained with antibodies to allow for identification


ELISA*

    Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays use ‘capture' antibodies that are fixed to a plate in order to trap specific antigens
    Following this, ‘detection' antibodies (linked to colour changing enzymes) are added to provide positive identification


* Tests that do not involve the amplification of the pathogen are typically used for screening as low pathogen levels will limit accuracy

ELISA


Modes of Transmission

Transmission of infectious pathogens can occur via either direct or indirect mechanisms

    Direct transmission: Via physical contact (e.g. exchange of body fluids via kissing, transfusions, etc.) or droplet spread
    Indirect transmission: Via airborne transfer, non-living vehicles (e.g. food, faeces, fomites) or vectors (living organisms)


modes of transmission


Animals can be important agents in the transmission of infectious pathogens either to, or between, human hosts

    Pathogens can be transferred to humans from infectious animals or shuttled between humans by unaffected animal carriers


Zoonotic Diseases

Diseases which are transferred from an animal host (usually a vertebrate) to a human host are called zoonotic diseases

    In this context, animals can act as a reservoir for the pathogen, allowing it to survive even if it is eradicated in humans
    This may facilitate the re-emergence of an infectious disease in a population where it had previously been eliminated


A specific example of a zoonotic disease is rabies, which is a viral disease that is transferred from dogs and bats (through bites)

    Many strains of bird flu or swine flu are also zoonoses that recombine with human strains (antigenic shift) to cause pandemics


Vector-Borne Diseases

Diseases which are transferred between human hosts by animal carriers (usually invertebrates) are called vector-borne diseases 

    Mechanical vectors are animals that transmit pathogens externally and so remain uninfected (e.g. flies spreading germs)
    Biological vectors are infected animals in which the pathogen undergoes a part of its life cycle (e.g. ticks and Lyme disease)


A specific example of a vector-borne disease is malaria, an acute febrile disease that can be fatal in humans

    The parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) undergoes part of its reproductive cycle (juvenile form) inside the Anopheles mosquito 
    The parasite is then transferred through bites to a human host, where it develops into an adult form that causes disease

Controlling Disease Spread

Scientific and social strategies may be employed to control the spread and distribution of a pathogenic infection

    Scientific strategies are interventions that act to reduce or stop the transmission and infection of a particular pathogen
    Social strategies are the policies put in place to support the scientific strategies and ensure their effective implementation


Scientific Strategies

Scientific strategies may vary according to the infectivity of the particular pathogen and its mode of transmission

    Vaccinations may be used to immunise the population and establish herd immunity
    Specific medications (e.g. antibiotics) may be developed via a process of rational drug design
    Contact tracing and health related databases may be used for monitoring and predicting disease spread
    Infectious individuals may be isolated through targeted protocols (such as quarantine or lockdowns)
    Pathogens may be eliminated via sterilisation procedures (e.g. water chlorination, fumigation)
    Disease-resistant vectors may be introduced via genetic engineering (e.g. sterile mosquitoes)


Social Strategies

Social strategies may commonly involve government legislations designed to support scientific interventions

    Advertisement campaigns designed to inform the public of associated risks (to help minimise exposure)
    Education programmes on appropriate hygiene practices (e.g. social distancing, correct use of insecticides)
    Providing adequate funding for scientific interventions (such as vaccination schedules, prophylactic equipment)
    Passing laws and mandates to ensure public compliance (e.g. customs act or vaccination mandate)

Vaccination

Key Knowledge:

    Vaccination programs and their role in maintaining herd immunity for a specific disease in a human population


Vaccinations are an example of artificial active immunity (they contain antigens to trigger immunity, but do not cause disease)

    Vaccines can limit pathogen spread and reduce the mortality rate or crippling effects associated with a particular disease
    However, protection may not be lifelong (booster shots may be required) and some individuals may have adverse reactions


Vaccinations induce long-term immunity to specific pathogenic infections by stimulating the production of memory cells

    A vaccine is a weakened or attenuated form of the pathogen that contains antigens but is incapable of triggering disease
    The antigenic determinants in a vaccine may be conjugated to an adjuvant, which functions to boost the immune response
    The body responds to an injected vaccine by initiating a primary immune response, which results in memory cells being made
    When exposed to the actual pathogen, the memory cells trigger a more potent secondary immune response
    As a consequence of this more potent immune response, disease symptoms do not develop (individual is immune to pathogen)


vaccination


The length of time a person is immune to infection following a vaccination depends on how long the memory cells survive for

    Memory cells may not survive a lifetime and individuals may subsequently require a booster shot to maintain immunity


Herd Immunity

Vaccination confers immunity to vaccinated individuals but also indirectly protects non-vaccinated individuals via herd immunity

    Herd immunity is when individuals who are not immune to a pathogen are protected from exposure by the large amounts of immune individuals within the community
    Herd immunity is important for vulnerable populations that may not be able to be vaccinated – including the elderly, extremely young and immune compromised individuals


The proportion of the population required to be vaccinated to confer herd immunity will be dependent on a number of factors:

    Disease spread will be dependent on the mode of transmission and period of infectivity (e.g. length of incubation period)
    Population density and social behaviour patterns will also determine the relative risk of exposure within a population
    For a moderately contagious, airborne pathogen (such as coronavirus), experts may aim for 80-90% immunity levels


herd immunity


Extension:  Small Pox

Vaccination programmes can be used to eliminate a disease within a region, or even eradicate it worldwide

    Smallpox was targeted by the World Health Organisation in 1967 and declared officially eradicated in 1980


The eradication of smallpox by vaccination was successful for a number of reasons:

    Smallpox was easily identifiable due to overt clinical symptoms, which helped to limit potential transmission
    Transmission only occurred via direct contact and there were no animal vectors or reservoirs to sustain the infectious agent
    The infection period was short lived (3 – 4 weeks) and the virus was stable and didn’t mutate into alternate strains
    There was global cooperation and immunity was long-term so repeated booster shots were unnecessary

Immunotherapy
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The development of immunotherapy strategies, including the use of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer


Immunotherapy involves the treatment of diseases with substances that moderate the body’s normal immune response

    Activation immunotherapies elicit or amplify an immune response while suppression immunotherapies will reduce the response
    Immunotherapy strategies may include the use of non-specific immunomodulators (cytokines) or specific monoclonal antibodies


Monoclonal Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies are specific antibodies artificially derived from a single B cell clone (mono = one type ; clonal = many copies)

    An animal (typically a mouse) is injected with an antigen in order to produce antigen-specific plasma cells
    The plasma cells are removed and fused (hybridised) with tumor cells capable of endless divisions (i.e. an immortal cell line)
    The resulting hybridoma cell is capable of synthesising large quantities of monoclonal antibody that can then be isolated for use


monoclonal antibodies


Cancer Treatment

Cancers are a class of diseases caused by uncontrolled cell division and can occur in any organ or tissue

    The abnormal cell growths (tumours) can remain in place (benign) or spread (malignant) and impact normal homeostatic processes


Because cancer cells are derived from the body’s own tissue (not ‘foreign’), they do not normally trigger a strong immune response 

    However, cancer cells will produce novel proteins (called neoantigens) that can be targeted (requires activation immunotherapy)


Monoclonal antibodies can be developed that are specific to these neoantigens and assist in cancer treatment in a variety of ways

    They can bind to the cancer cell and assist in its recognition and destruction by phagocytic leukocytes (i.e. opsonisation)
    They can target and inhibit immune checkpoint regulators on the cancer cell (checkpoint regulators control overall immune activity)
    They can be complexed to chemotherapy agents in order to help the drugs specifically target cancerous tissue


Autoimmune Diseases

Autoimmunity occurs when the immune system fails to recognise body cells as ‘self’ and begins targeting its own cells and tissues

    Some pathogens try to evade immune detection by producing antigens that closely resemble host markers (antigenic mimicry)
    Detection of these pathogens leads to the production of antibodies that recognise and target markers on body cells (cross reactivity)
    Examples of autoimmune diseases include diabetes (type I), rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis


Monoclonal antibodies treat autoimmune diseases by targeting pro-inflammatory proteins (involves suppression immunotherapy)

    By targeting surface proteins and cytokines involved in triggering an immune response, the effects of autoimmunity can be reduced
    For example, TNF (tumour necrosis factor) is a cytokine that acts as a key mediator for inflammatory-based immune responses
    Using monoclonal antibodies specific to TNF can reduce the inflammation-induced joint damage caused by rheumatoid arthritis
    Autoimmune diseases can also be treated by using monoclonal antibodies that target surface proteins involved in B cell proliferation
