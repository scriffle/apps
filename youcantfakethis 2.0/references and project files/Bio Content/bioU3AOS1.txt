Nucleic Acids

Key Knowledge:

    Nucleic acids as information molecules that encode instructions for the synthesis of proteins

    The structure of DNA, the three main forms of RNA (mRNA, rRNA and tRNA) and a comparison of their respective nucleotides


Nucleic acids are the genetic material of a cell and determine how both individual cells and entire organisms will develop and function

Nucleic acids function as the basic unit of inheritance by encoding for the synthesis of proteins (which carry out the genetic instructions)

Nucleotides

Nucleic acids are composed of recurring monomeric units called nucleotides, each of which contain three principal components:

    A central 5-carbon pentose sugar (pentagon), which is attached to a phosphate group (circle) and a nitrogenous base (rectangle)
    The carbon atoms of the sugar are numbered (1–5): the base connects to the 1’–C (right), the phosphate connects to the 5’–C (left)

nucleotide


Nucleotides are connected together via condensation reactions to form long single-strand molecules (nucleic acid = polymer)

    The phosphate group attaches to the sugar of a different nucleotide at the 3’–C position via a covalent (phosphodiester) bond
    The resulting chain of sugars and phosphates form a backbone, with the nitrogenous bases facing outwards as a sequential code


nucleic acid


Nitrogenous Bases

Each nucleotide contains one of four different nitrogenous bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine / uracil

    These bases can occur as either a double-ringed structure (purines) or as a single-ringed structure (pyrimidines)
    Thymine and uracil are almost chemically identical and perform the same function in different molecules (T = DNA ; U = RNA)


nitrogenous bases


When the nucleotides are joined together in a chain, the order of these bases will form a genetic sequence that may encode for a particular characteristic of the cell or organism (via the synthesis of a specific protein)

    Hence, variations in the base sequence will result in different genetic sequences and give rise to the production of unique traits


Types of Nucleic Acids

There are two main types of nucleic acids that differ in both their function and certain key structural aspects:

    DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) functions as the master copy of all genetic instructions and is stored in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells
    RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a transient copy that functions to transfer the genetic instructions from the nucleus to the rest of the cell


DNA and RNA possess certain structural differences that are reflective of their different roles within the cell

    RNA is a single-stranded molecule, whereas DNA is a double-stranded molecule (promotes conservation of the base sequence)
    RNA includes the base uracil, whereas DNA uses thymine instead (but the bases are almost identical and fulfil the same function)
    RNA and DNA are composed of different pentose sugars (RNA contains ribose, whereas DNA contains deoxyribose)


DNA vs RNA


Structure of DNA

Two chains of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonding between complementary bases (i.e. purine and pyrimidine)

    Adenine and Thymine pair via two hydrogen bonds (A = T) 
    Guanine and Cytosine pair via three hydrogen bonds (G Ξ C)


In order for the bases to be facing each other and thus able to pair, the strands must be running in opposite directions 

    The two DNA strands are described as being antiparallel (one strand runs 5’ → 3’ and the other strand runs 3’ → 5’)


As the antiparallel chains lengthen, the atoms will organise themselves into the most stable energy configuration  

    This atomic arrangement results in the double-stranded DNA forming a double helix (roughly 10 – 15 bases per twist)


DNA structure


Main Types of RNA

RNA functions to transfer genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the information is decoded (by ribosomes)

There are three main types of RNA which cooperate to complete this goal:

    Messenger RNA (mRNA) – a transcript copy of a specific DNA sequence (which encodes for the synthesis of a polypeptide)
    Transfer RNA (tRNA) – carries the polypeptide subunits (amino acids) to the organelle responsible for synthesis (ribosome)
    Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) – a primary component of the ribosome and is responsible for its catalytic activity


types of RNA


In essence, the relationship between the three types of RNA can be described as follows:

    Genetic instruction (within mRNA) → Protein ingredients (brought by tRNA) → Manufacture of product (catalysed by rRNA)

Proteins

Key Knowledge:

    Amino acids as the monomers of a polypeptide chain and the resultant hierarchical levels of structure that give rise to a functional protein

    Proteins as a diverse group of molecules that collectively make an organism’s proteome, including enzymes as catalysts in biochemical pathways


Proteins are a class of molecules that enact the genetic instructions within a cell and carry out a diverse array of functions

    Fibrous proteins are generally composed of long and narrow strands which are insoluble in water and have a structural role
    Globular proteins generally have a more compact and rounded shape, they are soluble in water and have functional roles 


Amino Acids

Proteins are comprised of long chains of recurring monomers called amino acids, which all share a basic structure:

    A central carbon is bound to an amine group (NH2), a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a hydrogen atom (H)
    Additionally, each amino acid contains a variable side chain (R) which gives the amino acid specific chemical properties


amino acid


There are 20 different amino acids which are naturally occurring and genetically incorporated by all living organisms (i.e. universal)

    Over 500 modified variants of amino acids are found in proteins, but only 20 amino acids are universally encoded by DNA sequences


Each amino acid has a distinctive side chain (variable group) with specific chemical properties that will cause the protein to fold and function differently according to the positions of the amino acids within the protein

    E.g. Membrane channel proteins have a hydrophobic exterior (face fatty acids) and a hydrophilic inner pore (allows ion passage) 


The 20 Universal Amino Acids (click on the diagram to swap between chemical and molecular representations)
My Image 1


Polypeptides

Amino acids can be covalently joined together in a condensation reaction to form a peptide bond (water is produced as a by-product)

    Two amino acids combine to form a dipeptide, and long chains of covalently bonded amino acids are called polypeptides
    Polypeptide chains can be broken down into reusable amino acids via hydrolysis reactions (requires water to reverse the process)


Peptide bonds are formed between the amine group (NH2) and carboxylic acid group (COOH) of adjacent amino acids

    The amine group loses a hydrogen (H) and the carboxylic acid loses a hydroxyl (OH): these combine to form water (H2O)


dipeptide


Levels of Protein Structure

Polypeptide chains coil and fold due to the properties of their amino acids to achieve different levels of protein structure

    Each level of protein structure builds on the previous level to determine the overall structural organisation of the protein


Primary (1º) Structure:

    The first level of structural organisation in a protein is the order of amino acids which comprise the polypeptide chain
    The primary structure is formed by covalent peptide bonds between the amine and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids
    Primary structure controls all subsequent levels because it determines the sequence of the R groups in the polypeptide chain


Secondary (2º) Structure

    The secondary structure is the way a polypeptide folds in a repeating arrangement to form α-helices and β-pleated sheets
    This folding is a result of hydrogen bonding between the amine and carboxyl groups of non-adjacent amino acids
    The α-helices increase the tensile strength of the polypeptide, while β-pleated sheets increase the mechanical stability
    Sequences that do not form either an alpha helix or beta-pleated sheet will exist as a random coil
    In pictures, alpha helices are represented as spirals and beta-pleated sheets are represented as arrows


Tertiary (3º) Structure

    The tertiary structure is the way the polypeptide chain coils and turns to form a complex molecular shape (i.e. the 3D shape)
    It is caused by interactions between R groups; including H-bonds, disulfide bridges, ionic bonds and hydrophobic interactions
    Relative amino acid positions are important (e.g. non-polar amino acids usually avoid exposure to aqueous solutions)
    Tertiary structure may be important for the function of the protein (e.g. specificity of active site in enzymes)


protein structure


Quaternary (4º) Structure

Certain proteins may possess a fourth level of structural organisation called a quaternary structure

    Quaternary structures are found in proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide chain linked together 
    Alternatively, proteins may have a quaternary structure if they include inorganic prosthetic groups within their structure
    Not all proteins will have a quaternary structure – many proteins will only consist of a single polypeptide chain


quaternary structure


An example of a protein with a quaternary structure is haemoglobin (an oxygen carrying molecule in red blood cells)

    Haemoglobin is composed of four polypeptide chains (two alpha chains and two beta chains)
    It is also composed of iron-containing haeme groups (prosthetic groups that are responsible for binding oxygen)


Denaturation

Because the way a protein folds determines its function, any change or abrogation to the tertiary structure will alter its activity

Denaturation is a structural change in a protein that results in the loss (usually permanent) of its biological properties

    Denaturation of proteins can usually be caused by two key conditions – temperature and pH


Temperature

    High levels of thermal energy may disrupt the hydrogen bonds that hold the protein together
    As these bonds are broken, the protein will begin to unfold and lose its capacity to function as intended
    Temperatures at which proteins denature may vary, but most human proteins function optimally at body temperature (~37ºC)

pH

    Amino acids are zwitterions, neutral molecules possessing both negatively (COO–) and positively (NH3+) charged regions 
    Changing the pH will alter the charge of the protein, which in turn will alter protein solubility and overall shape
    All proteins have an optimal pH which is dependent on the environment in which it functions (e.g. stomach = low pH)


denaturation


Functions of Proteins

Proteins are a very diverse class of compounds and may serve a number of different roles within a cell, including:
protein function

    Structure – e.g. collagen, spider silk
    Hormones – e.g. insulin, glucagon
    Immunity – e.g. immunoglobulins
    Transport – e.g. haemoglobin
    Sensation – e.g. rhodopsin
    Movement – e.g. actin, myosin
    Enzymes – e.g. Rubisco, catalase


Proteomes

The proteome is the totality of proteins expressed within a cell, tissue or organism at a certain time

    The proteome of any given individual will be unique, as protein expression patterns are determined by an individual’s genes


The proteome will typically be significantly larger than the number of genes in an individual due to a number of factors:

    Gene sequences may be alternatively spliced following transcription to generate multiple protein variants from a single gene
    Proteins may be modified (e.g. glycosylated, phosphorylated, etc.) following translation to promote further variations

Gene Expression
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The structure of genes: exons, introns and promoter and operator regions

    The genetic code as a universal triplet code that is degenerate and the steps in gene expression, including transcription, RNA processing in eukaryotic cells and translation by ribosomes

    The role of rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and associated vesicles in the export of proteins from a cell via the protein secretory pathway


The central dogma of molecular biology explains the flow of genetic information within the cell (i.e. DNA → RNA → Protein)

    DNA codes for RNA via the process of transcription (occurs within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells)
    RNA codes for protein via the process of translation (occurs at free ribosomes or at the rough ER)


While this information flow is typically unidirectional, certain viruses can convert RNA into DNA via the enzyme reverse transcriptase


Genes

A gene is a sequence of DNA which is transcribed into RNA and contain three main parts:

    Promoter:  A sequence that serves to initiate transcription – acts as a binding site for the transcribing enzyme (RNA polymerase)
    Coding Sequence:  The sequence of DNA that is actually transcribed into RNA (may contain non-coding introns in eukaryotes)
    Terminator:  The sequence that serves to terminate transcription (mechanism of termination differs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes)


Genes can be located on either of the two strands of DNA, allowing for the compact organisation of a cell’s genetic instructions


gene sections


Transcription

Transcription is the process by which an RNA sequence is produced from a DNA template

    RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and triggers the unwinding and separation of the DNA strands
    When the DNA strands are separated, free RNA nucleotides will align opposite their complementary base partner
    RNA polymerase then moves along the coding sequence and covalently joins the RNA nucleotides together
    At the terminator, RNA polymerase and the newly formed RNA strand both detach from the DNA template, and the DNA rewinds
    Many RNA polymerase enzymes can transcribe a DNA sequence sequentially, producing a large number of transcripts



RNA Processing

In eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcripts must first be processed in order to form mature messenger RNA (mRNA)

This processing assists in the nuclear export of the transcript and facilitates its recognition by translational machinery (ribosomes)


Examples of post-transcriptional processing include:

    Capping: A methyl group is added to the 5’-end of the transcript to protect against degradation by exonuclease
    Polyadenylation: A long chain of adenine nucleotides (a poly-A tail) is added to the 3’-end to improve the stability of the transcript


Additionally, eukaryotic genes contain non-coding sequences called introns, which must be removed prior to forming mature mRNA

    Introns are intruding sequences within a gene, whereas the protein-encoding regions are called exons (i.e. expressing sequences)
    When the introns are removed, the exons are fused together to form a continuous sequence that can then be translated
    The process by which introns are removed is called splicing (prokaryotic genes do not have introns and so do not require splicing) 


splicing


Splicing can also result in the removal of exons – a process known as alternative splicing

The selective removal of specific exons will result in the formation of different polypeptides from a single gene sequence

    For example, a particular protein may be membrane-bound or cytosolic depending on the presence of an anchoring motif


Translation

Translation is the process of protein synthesis in which the genetic information encoded in mRNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids on a polypeptide chain

    Ribosomes bind to mRNA in the cytosol and read the sequence in triplets of bases called codons (beginning with a start codon: AUG)
    Anticodons on tRNA molecules align opposite specific codons according to complementary base pairing (e.g. AUG = UAC)
    Each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid (according to a set of rules known as the genetic code)
    Ribosomes catalyse the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids (via condensation reactions)
    The ribosome moves along the mRNA molecule synthesising a polypeptide chain until it reaches a stop codon
    At this point translation ceases and the polypeptide chain is released (and can then fold into a functional protein)
    Multiple ribosomes can translate an mRNA transcript simultaneously (this group of ribosomes is called a polysome)



Genetic Code

The genetic code is the set of rules by which the information encoded within an mRNA sequence is converted into an amino acid sequence (i.e. polypeptide) by a living cell

    Codons are triplets of bases which encode for particular amino acids
    As there are four nitrogenous bases in RNA, there are 64 different codon combinations (4 x 4 x 4 = 64)
    The order of the codons will determine the amino acid sequence for a polypeptide chain 
    Translation always begins with a START codon (AUG) and terminates with a STOP codon


genetic code


The genetic code has the following features:

    It is universal - every living organism uses the same code (there are only a few rare and minor exceptions relating to viruses)
    It is degenerate - there are only 20 amino acids but 64 codons, so more than one codon may code for the same amino acid


Protein Destinations

Protein synthesis can occur at one of two locations within the cell depending on the function of the protein being produced

    Free ribosomes will synthesise cytosolic proteins that are required for use within the cell (i.e. intracellular proteins)
    Ribosomes bound to the rough ER will synthesise proteins that are destined for external use (i.e. extracellular proteins)


In the protein secretory pathway:

    Polypeptides synthesised within the rough ER will be packaged into a vesicle and transported to the Golgi apparatus
    The Golgi complex will potentially modify the protein (e.g. glycosylation) and then export it out of the cell via a vesicle (exocytosis)
    Proteins can either be secreted by the Golgi immediately (constitutive secretion) or stored for a delayed release (regulatory secretion)
    Proteins synthesised via this pathway can also be shuttled to other organelles besides the Golgi (e.g. mitochondria, lysosome, etc.)

Gene Regulation
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The basic elements of gene regulation: prokaryotic trp operon as a simplified example of a regulatory process


Genes can be categorised as being either structural or regulatory:

    Structural genes code for proteins that contribute to the overall form or function of a cell or organism
    Regulatory genes code for proteins that control levels of gene expression by altering transcription rates (i.e. switch genes on or off)


Gene regulation is mediated by a group of proteins called transcription factors (also known as regulatory proteins)


Transcription Factors

Transcription factors either mediate or impede the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter (and hence control transcription rates)

    Transcription factors that prevent transcription by impeding RNA polymerase action are called repressors
    Factors that promote transcription by increasing the affinity of RNA polymerase for the promoter are called activators


In prokaryotes, transcription factors bind to a region of DNA called the operator (proximal to the promoter) in order to moderate RNA polymerase binding

    In eukaryotes, transcription factors bind to more distant regions (silencer or enhancer sites) to regulate levels of overall transcription


The expression of transcription factors can be mediated by cell signals (e.g. hormones) that may be triggered by internal or external cues

    E.g. Humans may produce different levels of melanin (skin pigment) according to their overall level of sun exposure (i.e. sun tanning)


The trp Operon

The trp operon provides a simplified example of the basic elements of gene regulation in a prokaryotic cell

    An operon is a cluster of genes under the control of a single promoter


The trp operon codes for a number of enzymes that coordinate to promote the synthesis of tryptophan (a non-essential amino acid)

    The expression of the operon is controlled by a transcription factor called the trp repressor (produced by an upstream regulatory gene) 
    The trp repressor binds to an operator site (adjacent to promoter) and inhibits expression by preventing the action of RNA polymerase


Tryptophan binds to the repressor and triggering a conformational change that activates the protein

    When tryptophan levels are high, the trp repressor is active and the operon is switched off (preventing over-expression of tryptophan)
    When tryptophan levels are low, the trp repressor is inactive and the operon is switched on (so more tryptophan will be synthesised)


trp operon


Attenuation

Attenuation is an alternative method of reducing the expression of the trp operon in prokaryotic cells

    It relies on the capacity for prokaryotes to undertake transcription and translation at the same time (as the DNA is cytosolic)
    Whereas the trp repressor system blocks the initiation of transcription, attenuation blocks the completion of transcription


Located between the operator and trp genes is a leader sequence that encodes a short polypeptide containing two Trp residues

    When transcribed, this leader sequence contains several self-complementary sections that are capable of forming hairpin loops
    One such loop is called the attenuator and functions as a site of transcriptional termination when it is formed (transcription halts)
    Alternatively, an earlier loop called the anti-terminator may form, which prevents attenuator formation (so transcription continues)


The presence of tryptophan determines whether the attenuator or anti-terminator is formed within the leader sequence

    If tryptophan is in low supply, the ribosome will pause at the two Trp codons within the leader sequence
    This pause allows time for the anti-terminator to form on the mRNA transcript, so transcription will continue (operon is expressed)
    If tryptophan is in high supply, the ribosome will not need to pause at the two Trp codons within the leader sequence
    This means the anti-terminator is unable to form and the attenuator will form instead (transcription halted ; operon not expressed)


attenuation

Core Technologies

Key Knowledge:

    The use of enzymes to manipulate DNA, including polymerase to synthesise DNA, ligase to join DNA and endonucleases to cut DNA

    Amplification of DNA using polymerase chain reaction

    The use of gel electrophoresis in sorting DNA fragments, including the interpretation of gel runs for DNA profiling


The manipulation of DNA requires a variety of molecular components (enzymes) as well as numerous experimental techniques:

    Enzymes: Polymerase (copies DNA), endonuclease (cuts DNA) and ligase (pastes DNA)
    Techniques: PCR (amplifies DNA molecules) and gel electrophoresis (separates DNA molecules)


Enzymes

Enzymes are a class of proteins that function to catalyse chemical reactions (enabling them to proceed under favourable conditions)

    Polymerase is used to synthesise new strands of DNA from a template molecule (used in PCR to amplify DNA)
    Endonucleases (restriction enzymes) cut DNA backbones to generate blunt ends or complementary sticky ends
    Ligase covalently joins DNA backbones (with phosphodiester bonds) to paste disparate sequences of DNA together
    Reverse transcriptase converts mRNA sequences into cDNA sequences (with no introns) for bacterial transformations


biotech enzymes


Polymerase Chain Reaction

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an artificial method of replicating DNA under laboratory conditions

    The PCR technique is used to amplify large quantities of a specific sequence of DNA from an initial minute sample
    Each reaction doubles the amount of DNA – a standard PCR sequence of 30 cycles creates over 1 billion copies (230)


The reaction occurs in a thermal cycler and uses variations in temperature to control the replication process via three steps:

    Denaturation – DNA sample is heated (~90ºC) to separate the two strands
    Annealing – Sample is cooled (~55ºC) to allow primers to anneal (primers designate sequence to be copied)
    Elongation – Sample is heated to the optimal temperature for a heat-tolerant polymerase (Taq) to function (~75ºC)


Taq polymerase is an enzyme isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus

    As this enzyme’s optimal temperature is ~75ºC, it is able to function at the high temperatures used in PCR without denaturing
    Taq polymerase extends the nucleotide chain from the primers – therefore primers are used to select the sequence to be copied


PCR


Gel Electrophoresis

Gel electrophoresis is a laboratory technique used to separate and isolate DNA fragments based on their mass / size

    Samples of DNA are placed in the wells of an agarose gel and the gel is then submerged in a buffering solution
    An electric current is applied which causes the samples to move through the gel
    The fragments move towards the positive anode (as DNA is negatively charged due to the presence of phosphate groups)
    Smaller fragments are less impeded by the gel matrix and hence will move faster and further through the agarose gel
    This causes samples of different sizes to separate out as they travel at different speeds



DNA Profiling

DNA profiling is a technique by which individuals can be identified and compared via their respective DNA profiles

    Within the non-coding regions of the genome there exists satellite DNA – long stretches of DNA made up of repeating elements
    These repeating elements (short tandem repeats – STRs) will vary in length in different individuals (resulting in unique DNA profiles)


Comparative STR Lengths at Two Different Loci
STR


DNA profiling is commonly used in criminal investigations (i.e. forensics) and to settle paternity disputes

The procedure involved is common for both:

    A DNA sample is collected (e.g. from blood, semen, saliva, etc.) and then amplified using PCR
    STR loci are isolated (either by excising with restriction enzymes or by targeting these regions with specific primers during PCR)
    Fragment lengths will differ between individuals due to the variable length of their short tandem repeats
    The fragments are separated using gel electrophoresis and the resulting profiles are compared


Forensic Investigations:

Suspects should be a complete match with the DNA sample taken from the crime scene if a conviction is to occur

The number of loci used to generate a unique profile depends on the size of the population being compared

    E.g. America (population: ~ 320 million) uses 13 loci for comparison; Australia (population: ~ 25 million) uses only 9 loci

Paternity Testing:

Children inherit half their chromosomes from each parent and thus should possess a combination of parental fragments

    In other words, all fragments produced in the child should also be produced by either the mother or father

Genetic Modification
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The use of genetically modified and transgenic organisms in agriculture to increase crop productivity and to provide resistance to disease


Genetic modification describes the alteration of a genome using artificial genetic engineering technologies

    This is typically achieved by the addition or silencing of a specific gene such that a characteristic is either gained or lost
    To be identified as a genetically modified organism (GMO), the change should be heritable (able to be passed on)


Transgenics is a type of genetic modification where DNA is introduced from an unrelated species

    Hence, not all genetically modified organisms will necessarily be transgenic organisms (but all transgenic organisms are GMOs)


GMOs

Genetically modified organisms are used in agriculture and farming to address a variety of specific issues, including:

    Malnutrition: Golden rice has been engineered to produce high levels of vitamin A (which helps to prevent blindness)
    Pollution: Grains / cereals have been engineered with a low phytic acid content (when in manure, it pollutes soils and waterways)
    Longevity: Flavr Savr tomatoes have been engineered to have an increased shelf life (by deactivating the genes for ripening)
    Pest resistance: Bt corn has been engineered to be toxic to the European corn borer (a pest species that feeds on maize crops)
    Disease resistance: Blight resistant potatoes have been engineered (by including genes that trigger an immune defence to blight)
    Yield: Crops have been engineered to produce higher quantities or grow in adverse conditions (e.g. in arid or saline environments)


GMOs


Implications

The use of GM crops is a highly contentious issue, as any potential benefits must be weighed against all of the possible risks

    When assessing the impact of a GM crop it is important to consider potential health, economic and environmental implications


GM Crops and Human Health

    GM crops can be used to improve human nutritional standards, by incorporating genes for certain proteins, vitamin or vaccines
    Additionally, GM crops can be manufactured that lack common natural allergens or toxins
    However, the inclusion or removal of certain genes could trigger unexpected adverse health reactions in some individuals
    Currently, not all foods with GM components are labelled, making informed decisions of use difficult for consumers


GM Crops and Economic Consequences

    GM crops can include genes to enable them to grow in a wider range of environments (e.g. drought / frost / salinity resistance)
    GM crops can be manufactured to produce greater yields (crops can potentially grow larger and faster)
    GM crops can include genes which slow the rate of spoiling, leading to longer shelf lives for GM foods
    GM crops may possess resistance to certain viruses or produce toxins to pests (reducing need for the use of pesticides)
    Herbicide resistant crops can be used to allow for the easier killing of weeds (which compete with crops for soil nutrients)
    Overall, an improved yield, reduction in farming costs and ability to farm more land will provide an economic benefit to farmers
    However, patent protection allows biotech companies to restrict the use of seeds and force farmers to pay high prices for use


GM Crops and Environmental Issues

    The ability to farm a wider range of environments with GM crops will potentially reduce the need for associated deforestation
    Also, the generation of pest-resistant crops means that less chemical insecticides will be released into the environment
    However, GM crops could potentially reduce biodiversity in a region by competing with indigenous plant life
    Furthermore, proteins or toxins produced by GM crops could negatively affect certain organisms within the ecosystem
    Cross-pollination by GM crops could also result in the formation of herbicide-resistant weeds and grasses
    GM crops with pest toxins could also accelerate the evolution of resistant pest species

Gene Cloning
ninja icon
Key Knowledge:

    The use of recombinant plasmids as vectors to transform bacterial cells as demonstrated by the production of human insulin


Gene cloning is the process of isolating and copying a gene of interest in order to facilitate its expression within a host organism

Gene cloning occurs over three key stages:

    Isolation of a gene of interest and a vector (gene delivery vehicle)
    Insertion of the gene of interest into the vector (via digestion and ligation)
    Integration of the recombinant vector into a host cell (and subsequent gene expression)


Step 1: Isolating Gene and Vector

A gene is a sequence of DNA that encodes a specific characteristic (via the synthesis of proteins)

    DNA can be isolated from cells by centrifugation (heavier components – such as nuclei – are separated) and then precipitation
    The DNA can then be amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (using primers that specifically target the gene sequence)
    Gene sequences can also be generated from mRNA using reverse transcriptase – these DNA sequences (cDNA) lack introns


A vector is a molecule that is used as a vehicle to carry the gene of interest into a foreign cell

    Bacterial plasmids are commonly used as vectors because they are capable of autonomous self-replication and expression
    These plasmids may be modified for further functionality (e.g. selection markers, reporter genes, inducible expression promoters) 
    Other types of vectors include modified viruses (e.g. bacteriophages) and artificial chromosomes


Common Features of a Typical Plasmid Vector
plasmid


Step 2: Combining Gene and Vector

The incorporation the gene of interest into the plasmid vector involves two key processes:

    Digestion: Both the gene of interest and plasmid are cut with specific endonucleases (restriction enzymes)
    Ligation: The digested gene of interest and plasmid are then fused together to form a recombinant plasmid


In digestion, both a gene of interest and vector cut with restriction enzymes at specific recognition sites

    Restriction enzymes cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone to generate blunt ends or sticky ends (complementary overhangs)
    Scientists will often cleave the vector and gene with two different ‘sticky end’ restriction endonucleases (double digestion) to ensure the gene is inserted in the correct orientation and to prevent the vector from re-annealing without the desired insert


digestion


In ligation, the gene of interest is inserted into a plasmid vector that has been cut with restriction endonucleases

    If digestion produces sticky ends, then the ends must be complementary (i.e. cut with the same enzyme) for ligation to occur
    The gene and vector are spliced together by the enzyme DNA ligase to form a recombinant plasmid
    DNA ligase joins the vector and gene by fusing their sugar-phosphate backbones together with a covalent phosphodiester bond
    The recombinant plasmid can be separated and isolated from the standard plasmid (no gene included) using gel electrophoresis

Step 3: Integrating Recombinant Vector into Host Cell

The recombinant construct (including the gene of interest) is finally introduced into an appropriate host cell or organism

    This process is called transfection (for eukaryotic cells), transformation (for bacterial cells) or transduction (if a viral vector is used)
    A range of methods may be used to introduce the recombinant construct, including heat shocking, electroporation or liposomes


Antibiotic selection is commonly used in order to identify which cells have successfully incorporated the recombinant construct

    An antibiotic is a compound that specifically targets prokaryotic features (and hence kills or inhibits bacterial cell growth) 
    The plasmid vector contains an antibiotic resistance gene, so only transgenic cells will grow in the presence of antibiotic
    Antibiotic selection can also be used to successfully select for transgenic eukaryotic cells if the antibiotic targets the prokaryotic features of the chloroplast or mitochondria (these structures were once prokaryotes, but became organelles via endosymbiosis)

Application: Production of Human Insulin

The ability to transfer genes between species has been utilised to produce human insulin in bacteria (for mass production)

    Because the genetic code is universal, human genes can be expressed by bacterial cells provided introns are removed
    Reverse transcriptase can be used to create a cDNA copy of the human insulin gene without any intron sequences


The benefit of using transgenic bacteria to produce human insulin is that bacteria can divide and reproduce very rapidly

    When the bacteria is cultured in a fermentation tank, large quantities of human insulin can be produced in short periods of time
    Once produced, the human insulin is purified and packaged for human use (to treat individuals with type II diabetes mellitus)

Key Knowledge:

    The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria and the application of this function in editing an organism’s genome

    Potential uses and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies to improve photosynthetic efficiencies and crop yields


Gene editing involves the insertion, removal or replacement of DNA within the genome of a living organism

    The most precise, efficient and flexible method of gene editing currently available involves the CRISPR editing system


CRISPR-Cas9 System

The CRISPR-Cas9 system functions naturally in bacteria to provide immunity against viral infections

    When a virus infects a bacterial cell, snippets of viral DNA are pasted into palindromic sequences within the bacterial genome to form a CRISPR locus (CRISPR = ‘clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats’), which act as a memory bank for viral infections
    A CRISPR sequence is transcribed into an RNA strand that associates with a CRISPR-associated nuclease (e.g. Cas9)
    The RNA and Cas nuclease drift throughout the cell until the RNA locates and binds with any complementary viral DNA
    This enables the Cas nuclease to then destroy the viral DNA sequence and hence prevents any subsequent infection


Gene Editing

The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been modified to selectively remove any targeted sequence, allowing for precise gene editing

    The Cas protein is complexed with a synthetically derived guide RNA molecule that is complementary to a target sequence
    The guide RNA (gRNA) will bind to the target sequence, prompting its excision by the Cas nuclease
    Following the removal of the target sequence, another sequence of DNA can be integrated in its place (gene editing)


gene editing


Practical Applications

Gene editing via the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been used to address a variety of agricultural issues associated with food production

    Certain metabolic pathways have been enhanced to improve nutritional content (e.g. higher starch production)
    Plant absorption spectra have been modified to increase photosynthetic efficiencies (e.g. new pigments introduced)
    Higher tolerances to biotic pathogens (viral, bacterial, fungal) or abiotic stresses (cold, drought, salt) have been achieved
    Resistance to particular herbicides have been incorporated into crops to allow for elimination of competing weed species
    Improvements in photorespiration efficiencies has resulted in increased food production in a variety of common C3 plants
