Treat the student as calm and intelligent.

Student-Facing Language Guidelines
Use calm, professional language throughout. Students are already under pressure - the interface should feel supportive, not exhausting.

No exclamation marks in feedback or status messages
No emojis in user-facing text
Simple, direct praise: "Well done" not "Excellent!", "Complete" not "Perfect!"
Neutral confirmations: "All correct" not "Amazing work!"
Matter-of-fact status: "Round complete. Moving to Round 2" not "Great job! You crushed it!"
Calm warnings: "All progress will be cleared" not "ALL DATA LOST!"

The goal is quiet confidence - acknowledge progress without cheerleading. Let the student's own sense of achievement be the reward, not performative enthusiasm from the interface.
