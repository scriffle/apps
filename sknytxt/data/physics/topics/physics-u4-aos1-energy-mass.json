            "explanation": "The Higgs field gives quarks their fundamental masses (~10 MeV total), but the proton's 938 MeV mass mostly comes from the binding energy of the strong force holding quarks together."

            "text": "True. The Higgs mechanism gives fundamental fermions (quarks, leptons) their intrinsic masses. However, a proton's mass (938 MeV) comes mostly from the binding energy of quantum chromodynamics—the energy stored in gluon fields holding quarks together. The constituent quark masses from Higgs total only ~10 MeV. Most visible matter's mass comes from QCD binding energy, not Higgs masses.",
