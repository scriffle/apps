          "correctAnswer": "A 70-year-old typically has: less deep sleep (reduced Stage 3 NREM), more frequent awakenings, and lighter overall sleep compared to a 25-year-old who has robust deep sleep and consolidated sleep periods. These changes occur due to: age-related changes in brain structures that generate slow waves, altered neurotransmitter systems, and changes in circadian rhythm amplitude that reduce the drive for deep sleep.",
