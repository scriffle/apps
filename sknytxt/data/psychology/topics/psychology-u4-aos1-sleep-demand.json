Early school start times force adolescents to wake before their biological clock is ready. Consequences include: (1) Chronic sleep deprivation leading to poor academic performance and difficulty concentrating; (2) Increased risk of depression, anxiety, and emotional regulation problems due to insufficient sleep.",

These changes occur due to: age-related changes in brain structures that generate slow waves, altered neurotransmitter systems, and changes in circadian rhythm amplitude that reduce the drive for deep sleep.",
