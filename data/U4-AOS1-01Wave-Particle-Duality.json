  "explanations": {
    "electrons": "Electrons were the first particles experimentally shown to exhibit wave-like diffraction patterns (Davisson-Germer experiment, 1927). This confirmed de Broglie's hypothesis about matter waves.",
    "de Broglie wavelength": "The de Broglie wavelength (λ = h/p) is the wavelength associated with any moving particle, named after Louis de Broglie who proposed that all matter has wave properties.",
    "crystal lattice": "A crystal lattice provides regularly spaced atoms that act as a diffraction grating for electron waves. The spacing between atoms is similar to electron wavelengths, enabling diffraction.",
    "interference pattern": "When waves pass through multiple openings, they create an interference pattern of alternating bright and dark regions due to constructive and destructive interference.",
    "wave-particle duality": "Wave-particle duality is the fundamental principle that all quantum objects exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on how they're observed.",
    "particles": "In quantum mechanics, 'particles' refers to discrete, localized entities that can be counted individually, contrasting with continuous wave behavior.",
    "mass": "Photons are unique as massless particles that still carry momentum (p = E/c). Their momentum comes from their energy, not mass.",
    "momentum": "Despite having no mass, photons carry momentum (p = E/c = h/λ) which can exert radiation pressure and transfer momentum in collisions.",
    "pc": "For photons, E = pc relates energy to momentum (where c is light speed). This differs from massive particles where E = mc² + kinetic energy.",
    "speed of light": "The speed of light (c = 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s) is the universal speed limit and the speed at which all electromagnetic radiation travels in vacuum.",
    "Planck's constant": "Planck's constant (h = 6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) is the fundamental constant that relates a photon's energy to its frequency (E = hf) and wavelength to momentum (λ = h/p).",
    "h/p": "The de Broglie equation λ = h/p applies to both matter and photons, showing that wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum for all quantum objects.",
    "identically spaced": "When matter and photons have the same wavelength and pass through identical gaps, they produce identically spaced diffraction patterns, demonstrating their wave similarity.",
    "λ/w": "The ratio λ/w (wavelength/gap width) determines diffraction severity. When λ/w ≥ 1, significant diffraction occurs, limiting resolution in microscopy.",
    "≥ 1": "Significant diffraction occurs when λ/w ≥ 1, meaning the wavelength is similar to or larger than the gap size, causing severe spreading of waves.",
    "smaller": "Electrons have much smaller de Broglie wavelengths than visible light at practical energies, enabling much higher resolution in electron microscopes.",
    "damage": "While X-rays have short wavelengths, their high energy can damage biological samples through ionization. Electrons cause less damage at similar resolutions.",
    "viruses": "Electron microscopes are ideal for imaging viruses (20-300 nm) because electron wavelengths can be made much smaller than viral dimensions.",
    "diffraction": "Diffraction is the spreading of waves when passing through openings or around obstacles, fundamentally limiting the resolution of all wave-based imaging.",
    "wavelength": "The wavelength of the probing radiation fundamentally limits imaging resolution - you cannot clearly resolve objects smaller than about half the wavelength used.",
    "10⁻¹²": "Modern electron microscopes can achieve picometer (10⁻¹² m) wavelengths with high-energy electrons, enabling atomic-scale resolution.",
    "radiation damage": "X-ray microscopy causes radiation damage through ionization, breaking chemical bonds in biological samples. This limits its use for living specimens.",
    "significant": "When λ/w ratio approaches or exceeds 1, diffraction effects become significant enough to severely blur images and limit resolution.",
    "atoms": "The ultimate achievement of electron microscopy is resolving individual atoms, possible because electron wavelengths can be made smaller than atomic dimensions.",
    "one at a time": "Sending particles one at a time through double slits proves that interference isn't between different particles - each particle interferes with itself.",
    "spot": "Each individual photon or electron creates a single spot on the detector, demonstrating particle-like detection despite wave-like propagation.",
    "particle": "The discrete detection of individual impacts shows the particle nature of photons and electrons, even as they display wave interference.",
    "itself": "The most profound result: each particle must somehow pass through both slits and interfere with itself to create the pattern, defying classical logic.",
    "individual": "Modern experiments fire individual particles to ensure no inter-particle interference, yet the wave pattern still emerges from accumulated single impacts.",
    "discrete": "Each particle registers as a discrete, localized impact rather than a spread-out wave, showing the measurement collapses the wave function.",
    "interference": "The accumulated pattern shows interference fringes characteristic of waves, proving the wave nature despite particle-by-particle detection.",
    "individually": "Particles traveling individually (not in groups) still create interference patterns, proving each particle has wave properties.",
    "quantum mechanics": "This paradox epitomizes quantum mechanics - the need for a new physics framework to understand wave-particle complementarity.",
    "superposition": "Quantum superposition allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured, explaining how one particle can interfere with itself.",
    "randomly": "Individual impacts appear randomly distributed, yet their statistical accumulation forms a predictable interference pattern.",
    "probabilistic": "Quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic - we can predict the pattern statistically but not individual particle positions.",
    "complementarity": "Bohr's complementarity principle states that wave and particle descriptions are complementary aspects of the same quantum reality.",
    "inversely proportional": "In λ = h/p, wavelength and momentum are inversely proportional - doubling momentum halves the wavelength.",
    "short": "High-energy particles have short wavelengths due to their large momentum, enabling high-resolution imaging applications.",
    "6.63 × 10⁻³⁴": "Planck's constant (6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) is tiny, explaining why quantum effects only become noticeable at atomic scales.",
    "quantum": "Quantum effects dominate when the de Broglie wavelength becomes comparable to the system size, typically at atomic scales.",
    "3.0 × 10⁸": "The speed of light (3.0 × 10⁸ m/s) appears in photon momentum (p = E/c) since photons always travel at this speed.",
    "E = pc": "For massless photons, all energy is kinetic: E = pc. This differs from massive particles where E includes rest mass energy.",
    "1": "When λ/w = 1, the wavelength equals the gap width, marking the threshold for severe diffraction effects.",
    "400-700 nm": "Visible light spans 400-700 nm, limiting optical microscopes to resolving structures larger than about 200 nm (half the wavelength).",
    "nanometer": "Electron microscopes achieve nanometer (10⁻⁹ m) or better resolution, far surpassing optical microscopes limited by light wavelengths.",
    "ionize": "X-rays ionize atoms by ejecting electrons, breaking molecular bonds and damaging biological specimens during imaging.",
    "proteins": "Electron microscopy can image proteins and other biological macromolecules without the severe radiation damage caused by X-rays.",
    "wave nature": "The wave nature of electrons enables diffraction-based imaging, with resolution determined by the de Broglie wavelength.",
    "extremely small": "Macroscopic objects have extremely small de Broglie wavelengths (due to large mass/momentum), making wave properties unobservable.",
    "unobservable": "Wave properties become unobservable when wavelengths are vastly smaller than any measurable dimension or experimental apparatus.",
    "λ = h/p": "The universal de Broglie relation λ = h/p applies to all matter and radiation, unifying the wave description of particles and photons.",
    "energy": "Photon momentum derives from energy (p = E/c) rather than mass, showing energy itself carries momentum.",
    "collisions": "Photon-matter collisions demonstrate momentum transfer through radiation pressure, proving photons carry real momentum despite zero mass.",
    "wavelengths": "When particles have equal wavelengths (λ = h/p), they produce identical diffraction patterns regardless of their mass or nature.",
