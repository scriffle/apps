      "what": "This subtopic covers the structure and function of DNA and RNA as information molecules. You will learn how nucleotides are assembled into nucleic acid polymers and how the structural differences between DNA and RNA relate to their distinct roles in the cell.",
      "why": "Understanding nucleic acids is foundational to all of molecular biology. These molecules carry the instructions for building proteins, and their structure directly determines how genetic information is stored, copied, and transferred within cells.",

          "what": "DNA is the master copy of genetic instructions stored in the nucleus, while RNA is a transient copy used to transfer these instructions to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis.",
          "why": "This distinction explains why genetic information is preserved reliably in DNA while being actively used through RNA intermediates.",
          "example": "When a cell needs to make insulin, the DNA sequence for insulin stays safely in the nucleus while an RNA copy travels to the ribosome where the protein is actually made."

          "why": "Knowing how nucleotides are structured helps you understand how they link together and why DNA and RNA have specific properties.",
          "example": "In a nucleotide diagram, the sugar is drawn as a pentagon with carbons numbered 1' to 5'. The phosphate attaches at the 5' position (left side) and the base at the 1' position (right side)."

          "why": "This bonding pattern creates the directionality of DNA and RNA strands (5' to 3'), which is essential for understanding replication and transcription.",
          "example": "When two nucleotides join, a water molecule is released as the phosphate of one nucleotide bonds to the 3'-carbon of another, forming a chain like: sugar-phosphate-sugar-phosphate."

          "why": "The size difference between purines and pyrimidines is why base pairing always involves one of each, maintaining a consistent width of the DNA double helix.",
          "example": "Adenine (A) and guanine (G) are purines with two rings. Cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U) are pyrimidines with one ring. Remember: 'Pure As Gold' for purines A and G."

          "what": "DNA is double-stranded with deoxyribose sugar and thymine, while RNA is single-stranded with ribose sugar and uracil instead of thymine.",
          "why": "These structural differences reflect their functions: DNA's double strand protects genetic information, while RNA's single strand allows it to fold into functional shapes and be readily degraded after use.",
          "example": "Deoxyribose lacks one oxygen atom compared to ribose (hence 'deoxy'). This makes DNA more chemically stable than RNA, which is appropriate for long-term information storage."

          "what": "DNA consists of two strands held by hydrogen bonds between complementary bases (A=T with 2 bonds, G≡C with 3 bonds). The strands run antiparallel (one 5'→3', the other 3'→5') and twist into a double helix.",
          "why": "Complementary base pairing enables accurate DNA replication, while the double helix structure provides stability and compact storage of genetic information.",
          "example": "If one DNA strand reads 5'-ATGCCA-3', the complementary strand runs 3'-TACGGT-5'. The G-C pairs are stronger (3 hydrogen bonds) than A-T pairs (2 bonds), so GC-rich regions are harder to separate."

          "why": "The R group determines each amino acid's unique properties, which in turn determines how a protein will fold and function.",
          "example": "Glycine has the simplest R group (just a hydrogen), while phenylalanine has a large aromatic ring. These different R groups cause proteins to fold differently."

          "why": "These properties determine how amino acids interact with each other and their environment, driving protein folding and determining which parts of a protein face outward versus inward.",
          "example": "Membrane proteins have hydrophobic amino acids on their exterior (facing the fatty membrane) and hydrophilic amino acids lining any internal channels (allowing ions to pass through)."

          "why": "Understanding peptide bond formation helps you understand how proteins are built during translation and how they can be broken down by hydrolysis.",
          "example": "When alanine and glycine join, the -OH from alanine's COOH and the -H from glycine's NH₂ combine to release H₂O, leaving a peptide bond (-CO-NH-) connecting the two amino acids."

Tertiary structure is the 3D shape (R group interactions). Quaternary structure involves multiple polypeptides or prosthetic groups.",
          "why": "Each level builds on the previous one, and disrupting any level can cause the protein to lose function. This hierarchy explains how a linear sequence becomes a functional 3D molecule.",
          "example": "Haemoglobin has quaternary structure: four polypeptide chains (two α, two β) plus four haeme groups. Each chain has its own tertiary structure with α-helices (secondary) built from a specific amino acid sequence (primary)."

          "code": "U3AOS1.12",
          "what": "Denaturation is a structural change in a protein that causes loss of biological function. It is typically caused by temperature changes (disrupting hydrogen bonds) or pH changes (altering protein charge).",
          "why": "Denaturation explains why enzymes have optimal temperature and pH ranges, and why fever or acidosis can disrupt normal body function.",
          "example": "Cooking an egg denatures the albumin protein: heat breaks hydrogen bonds, causing the protein to unfold and aggregate, turning the egg white from clear and runny to white and solid. This change is irreversible."

          "what": "Proteins serve many functions: structural (collagen in skin), hormonal (insulin regulating blood sugar), immune (antibodies), transport (haemoglobin carrying oxygen), enzymatic (catalase breaking down hydrogen peroxide), and movement (actin and myosin in muscles).",
          "why": "This diversity shows how the same basic building blocks (amino acids) can create molecules with vastly different properties and roles, all determined by their sequence and structure.",
          "example": "Collagen is a fibrous protein with a rope-like structure providing tensile strength to tendons. Haemoglobin is a globular protein with a compact shape containing iron-binding sites for oxygen transport. Same building blocks, completely different functions."

          "what": "The proteome is all proteins expressed in a cell, tissue, or organism at a given time. It is larger and more variable than the genome due to alternative splicing and post-translational modifications.",
          "why": "The proteome explains how different cell types with identical DNA can have different structures and functions—they express different subsets of proteins.",
          "example": "A human has about 20,000 genes but over 100,000 different proteins. One gene can produce multiple protein variants through alternative splicing (removing different exons) and modifications like adding sugar groups (glycosylation)."

          "why": "This concept provides the framework for understanding how genes are expressed and why DNA is considered the fundamental unit of heredity.",
          "example": "HIV is a retrovirus that uses reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA genome into DNA, which then integrates into the host cell's genome. This is an exception to the usual one-way flow of information."

          "what": "A gene consists of a promoter (where RNA polymerase binds to start transcription), a coding sequence (the part that is transcribed), and a terminator (where transcription stops).",
          "why": "Understanding gene structure explains how transcription is controlled and why mutations in different regions have different effects.",
          "example": "A mutation in the promoter might prevent RNA polymerase from binding, so the gene is never transcribed. A mutation in the coding sequence might change the resulting protein. A mutation in the terminator might produce an abnormally long transcript."

          "why": "Transcription is the first step in gene expression and creates RNA copies that can leave the nucleus while the DNA master copy stays protected.",
          "example": "If the DNA template strand reads 3'-TACGGA-5', RNA polymerase will synthesise an mRNA strand reading 5'-AUGCCU-3' (note: uracil replaces thymine in RNA)."

          "what": "Eukaryotic RNA processing includes capping (adding a methyl group to the 5' end), polyadenylation (adding a poly-A tail to the 3' end), and splicing (removing introns and joining exons).",
          "why": "These modifications protect the mRNA from degradation, help it exit the nucleus, and ensure only the coding regions are translated.",
          "example": "A freshly transcribed mRNA might be 10,000 nucleotides long. After splicing removes the introns, the mature mRNA might be only 2,000 nucleotides. The cap and poly-A tail are then added before export to the cytoplasm."

          "what": "Alternative splicing is the selective removal of different exons from the same pre-mRNA, resulting in different mature mRNAs and therefore different protein variants from a single gene.",
          "why": "Alternative splicing explains how organisms can produce more proteins than they have genes, increasing proteomic diversity without increasing genome size.",
          "example": "The gene for tropomyosin can be spliced differently in muscle cells versus brain cells. The resulting proteins have different properties suited to their tissue-specific functions."

          "what": "During translation, ribosomes read mRNA codons starting at AUG. tRNA molecules with complementary anticodons bring specific amino acids. Peptide bonds form between amino acids until a stop codon is reached.",
          "why": "Translation is where the genetic code is actually decoded into protein, making it the key step where genetic information becomes functional molecules.",
          "example": "The mRNA sequence AUG-GCA-UAA would be translated as: start codon (AUG, methionine) - GCA (alanine) - stop codon (UAA). The resulting dipeptide would be Met-Ala."

          "code": "U3AOS1.21",
          "what": "The genetic code is a triplet code (three bases per codon), universal (same in almost all organisms), and degenerate (multiple codons can code for the same amino acid). There are 64 codons, including one start codon (AUG) and three stop codons.",
          "why": "The universality of the genetic code allows genes to be transferred between species (e.g., human insulin gene in bacteria). Degeneracy provides some protection against mutations.",
          "example": "The amino acid leucine is encoded by six different codons (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG). This means a mutation in the third position of a leucine codon often still produces leucine—a silent mutation."

          "example": "E. coli has five structural genes in the trp operon (trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, trpA) that work together to synthesise tryptophan. Having them in an operon means they are all switched on or off together."
