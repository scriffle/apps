      "name": "Understanding Forces",
      "icon": "💪",
      "what": "This subtopic covers the fundamental concept of what a force is, how forces affect objects, and how we represent and measure forces. You will learn that forces are pushes or pulls that always involve an interaction between two objects.",
      "why": "Understanding forces is essential because forces explain why objects move, stop, speed up, slow down, or change shape. Every physical interaction you experience involves forces, from opening a door to catching a ball.",

          "title": "I can define a force as a push or a pull that involves an interaction between two objects",
          "code": "1.1.1",
          "what": "A force is not something an object contains. It always involves one object exerting a push or pull on another object.",
          "why": "This definition helps you identify forces in any situation by looking for the two objects involved in the interaction.",
          "example": "When you kick a football, your foot (object 1) exerts a push force on the ball (object 2). The force is the interaction between your foot and the ball.",

                "correct": "Forces are interactions between objects, not something stored inside an object",
                "correctExplanation": "A force always involves two objects interacting. The ball doesn't contain force; it experiences force when another object acts on it.",
                "distractors": [
                  {"answer": "The ball actually has energy, not force, stored in it", "explanation": "While it's true the ball has kinetic energy, this doesn't address the fundamental error about what forces are."},
                  {"answer": "The statement is correct because the kick transferred force into the ball", "explanation": "Force cannot be transferred or stored. Force is an interaction, not a substance."},
                  {"answer": "The ball loses its force quickly due to air resistance", "explanation": "This accepts the misconception that force is something objects contain."}

                "correctExplanation": "Force is not something objects have or contain. It only exists during interactions between objects.",
                "distractors": [

                  {"answer": "You don't have enough force stored in your body", "explanation": "Force is not stored in bodies. The issue is the lack of something to interact with."},

                "distractors": [
                  {"answer": "The diagram is correct because the kick put force into the ball", "explanation": "Force cannot be put into objects. The kick force stopped when foot and ball separated."},
