      "what": "This subtopic covers the fundamental concept of what a force is, how forces affect objects, and how we represent and measure forces. You will learn that forces are pushes or pulls that always involve an interaction between two objects.",
      "why": "Understanding forces is essential because forces explain why objects move, stop, speed up, slow down, or change shape. Every physical interaction you experience involves forces, from opening a door to catching a ball.",

          "why": "This definition helps you identify forces in any situation by looking for the two objects involved in the interaction.",
          "example": "When you kick a football, your foot (object 1) exerts a push force on the ball (object 2). The force is the interaction between your foot and the ball.",

                  {"answer": "Balls are too small to have force", "explanation": "Size doesn't determine whether something can be involved in a force. The issue is that NO object 'contains' force - force is always an interaction."},

          "why": "Recognising these effects allows you to work backwards from what you observe to identify what forces must be acting.",
          "example": "When a tennis player hits a ball with a racquet, the force changes the direction the ball is moving. When you knead dough, the force changes its shape."

          "why": "Force diagrams allow you to visualise and compare multiple forces acting on an object, which helps predict how the object will move.",
          "example": "A diagram of a book on a table shows a short arrow pointing down (gravity) and an equally short arrow pointing up (the table pushing back). Equal arrow lengths show balanced forces."

          "why": "Using standard units allows scientists to communicate and compare force measurements precisely.",

          "example": "When you carry a bag by its strap, the strap experiences tension. The tension force pulls inward along the strap, supporting the weight of the bag."

          "why": "These forces affect the speed of vehicles, falling objects, and swimmers, and must be considered in design and performance.",
          "example": "A parachute works by increasing air resistance. The large surface area of the parachute creates a strong upward air resistance force that slows the skydiver's fall."

          "why": "This calculation is used constantly in physics to determine how objects will move when multiple opposing forces act on them.",
          "example": "A parachutist experiences 1500 N of gravity downward and 800 N of air resistance upward. Net force = 1500 N - 800 N = 700 N downward. The parachutist accelerates downward."

          "example": "An 80 kg astronaut on the ISS still has a weight of about 704 N (using g = 8.8 N/kg at that altitude). They float because the station falls with them, not because gravity has disappeared."
