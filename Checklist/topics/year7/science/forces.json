          "question": "A gymnast pushes off a springboard (which bends), flies through the air while slowing down, then lands on a foam mat that compresses under her feet before she comes to rest. Which combination correctly identifies ALL the effects of forces in this sequence?",
          "correct": "Start moving, change shape (springboard), slow down, change shape (mat), stop moving",
          "correctExplanation": "The gymnast experiences five effects: the push starts her moving, the springboard changes shape, air resistance slows her down, the mat changes shape on landing, and friction stops her movement.",
          "distractors": [
            {
              "answer": "Start moving, change direction, slow down, stop moving",
              "explanation": "This misses the two 'change shape' effects (springboard bending and mat compressing). These are important force effects that happen to objects, not just to the gymnast."
            },
            {
              "answer": "Change shape (springboard), speed up, change direction, change shape (mat)",
              "explanation": "The gymnast slows down after leaving the springboard due to air resistance and gravity—she doesn't speed up or change direction during the flight. This also misses 'start moving' and 'stop moving'."
            },
            {
              "answer": "Start moving, slow down, stop moving",
              "explanation": "This only identifies effects on the gymnast's motion and ignores the force effects on objects—both the springboard and mat change shape due to forces applied to them."

      "toLevel5": [
        {
          "question": "A compass needle points north while resting on a table. Three forces act on the needle: gravity pulling it down, the table pushing it up, and magnetism from Earth aligning it. Which statement correctly classifies ALL three forces?",
          "correct": "Gravity is non-contact, the table's push is contact, and magnetism is non-contact",
          "correctExplanation": "Gravity and magnetism both act at a distance without objects touching (non-contact). The table must physically touch the needle to push it up (contact).",
          "distractors": [
            {
              "answer": "All three are non-contact forces because none of them are applied by a person",
              "explanation": "Whether a force is contact or non-contact depends on whether objects must touch, not who applies the force. The table must touch the needle to support it, making it a contact force."
            },
            {
              "answer": "Gravity is contact because the Earth is so large, the table's push is contact, and magnetism is non-contact",
              "explanation": "The size of an object doesn't determine if a force is contact or non-contact. Gravity acts at a distance without touching—an object experiences gravity even when not touching the ground."
            },
            {
              "answer": "Gravity is non-contact, the table's push is non-contact because it's always acting, and magnetism is contact",
              "explanation": "A force being 'always present' doesn't make it non-contact. The table must physically touch the needle to push up on it. Magnetism acts at a distance without touching."

      "learning_intention": "I can calculate the efficiency of a simple machine using the formula: efficiency = (force without machine ÷ force with machine) × 100",
      "toLevel5": [
        {
          "question": "A student needs 24 N to lift a toolbox straight up. Using a ramp, they only need 8 N to push it up to the same height. They calculate efficiency as (8 ÷ 24) × 100 = 33%. Their friend says this is wrong. What is the correct efficiency and why?",
          "correct": "300% — the formula should be (force without ÷ force with), so (24 ÷ 8) × 100 = 300%",
          "correctExplanation": "Efficiency measures how much easier the machine makes the task. Dividing the original force by the reduced force gives 300%, meaning the ramp makes the task 3 times easier.",
          "distractors": [
            {
              "answer": "33% — the student's calculation is correct because you divide the smaller number by the larger",
              "explanation": "This reverses the formula. Efficiency shows how much the machine helps, so we divide what you needed WITHOUT the machine by what you need WITH it. A lower efficiency would mean the machine makes work harder, not easier."
            },
            {
              "answer": "100% — the ramp doesn't create or destroy energy, so efficiency must equal 100%",
              "explanation": "This confuses energy efficiency with mechanical advantage efficiency. The formula given measures how much easier the machine makes applying force, not energy conversion. Values over 100% are normal for force reduction."
            },
            {
              "answer": "16 N — efficiency should be calculated as 24 N − 8 N = 16 N saved",
              "explanation": "Efficiency is expressed as a percentage, not in newtons. Subtracting forces tells you the force difference, but not how much easier the machine made the task relative to the original effort."

          "question": "A skydiver weighing 800 N experiences 500 N of air resistance. What is the net force, and what happens to the skydiver's speed?",
          "correct": "Net force is 300 N downward, so the skydiver speeds up",
          "correctExplanation": "Subtracting opposing forces: 800 N − 500 N = 300 N. The net force acts in the direction of the larger force (downward). An unbalanced downward force causes the skydiver to accelerate (speed up) as they fall.",
          "distractors": [
            {
              "answer": "Net force is 1300 N downward, so the skydiver speeds up",
              "explanation": "Forces in opposite directions subtract, not add. Adding gives an incorrect net force. When forces oppose each other, the smaller partially cancels the larger."
            },
            {
              "answer": "Net force is 300 N downward, so the skydiver moves at constant speed",
              "explanation": "The net force calculation is correct, but the prediction is wrong. Constant speed only occurs when forces are balanced (net force = 0). An unbalanced 300 N force causes acceleration, not constant speed."
            },
            {
              "answer": "Net force is 300 N upward, so the skydiver slows down",
              "explanation": "The direction is wrong. The net force acts in the direction of the larger force, which is the weight (800 N downward). Since gravity exceeds air resistance, the net force is downward, causing the skydiver to speed up."

          "question": "An astronaut has a mass of 80 kg on Earth where g = 10 N/kg. They travel to the Moon where g = 1.6 N/kg. Which statement correctly describes what happens to their mass and weight?",
          "correct": "Mass stays at 80 kg; weight changes from 800 N on Earth to 128 N on the Moon",
          "correctExplanation": "Mass is the amount of matter and doesn't change with location—it stays 80 kg. Weight depends on gravitational field strength: Earth weight = 80 × 10 = 800 N; Moon weight = 80 × 1.6 = 128 N.",
          "distractors": [
            {
              "answer": "Both mass and weight stay the same because the astronaut's body doesn't change",
              "explanation": "Mass stays the same, but weight changes. Weight is the gravitational force on an object, which depends on the local gravitational field strength. Weaker gravity on the Moon means less weight."
            },
            {
              "answer": "Mass changes to 12.8 kg on the Moon; weight stays at 800 N",
              "explanation": "This has it backwards. Mass is constant regardless of location—it measures the amount of matter. Weight is what changes because it depends on gravitational field strength (W = m × g)."
            },
            {
              "answer": "Mass stays at 80 kg; weight becomes 0 N because there is no gravity on the Moon",
              "explanation": "The Moon does have gravity—it's just weaker than Earth's. The Moon's gravitational field strength is 1.6 N/kg, so weight = 80 × 1.6 = 128 N, not zero."
