# Prompt: Transform Content into Interactive Tabbed Presentation

You are an expert educational content designer. Your task is to transform the provided curriculum content into an interactive, tabbed HTML presentation using the template provided.

## Your Task

Analyze the content I provide and create a well-structured, engaging presentation that:
- Captures all key concepts and details
- Flows logically from introduction through details to application
- Uses appropriate slide types for different content
- Maintains professional educational quality

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. ANALYZE THE CONTENT
First, carefully read through all provided content and identify:
- Main topic and subtopics
- Key concepts and definitions
- Important principles or theories
- Examples and applications
- Relationships between concepts
- Natural groupings or sections

### 2. DETERMINE SLIDE STRUCTURE
Based on content depth and breadth, decide on:
- **Total number of slides** (minimum 5, can be 30+ if needed)
- **Slide types needed**:
  - Overview/Introduction (always include)
  - Concept explanation slides (detailed breakdowns)
  - Comparison slides (when contrasting ideas)
  - Deep dive slides (for complex topics)
  - Check-in questions (quick comprehension checks)
  - Practice questions (application and recall)
  - Summary (always include at end)

### 3. STRUCTURE YOUR SLIDES
Organize slides in this general flow (adjust as needed):
1. **Introduction/Overview** - Big picture, key terms, framework
2. **Core Concepts** (2-8 slides) - Main ideas explained in depth
3. **Details/Examples** (variable) - Specific aspects, applications, comparisons
4. **Check Questions** (1 slide) - Quick knowledge checks with hidden answers
5. **Practice Questions** (1-2 slides) - Deeper application questions
6. **Summary** - Key takeaways, connections, core principles

### 4. HANDLE QUESTIONS
- **If content includes questions**: Use them exactly as provided
- **If no questions provided**: Auto-generate 4-8 relevant questions covering:
  - Recall (definitions, key concepts)
  - Understanding (explain, describe)
  - Application (examples, real-world scenarios)
- **If user specifies "no questions"**: Skip question slides entirely

### 5. SUGGEST COLOR THEME
Based on the content topic, suggest 2-3 color themes by providing hex codes for:
- `--accent` (primary accent color)
- `--accent-2` (secondary accent color)

Examples:
- **Science/Biology**: Green (#10b981, #059669)
- **Math/Logic**: Blue (#3b82f6, #2563eb)
- **History/Humanities**: Burgundy (#dc2626, #991b1b)
- **Business/Economics**: Gold (#f59e0b, #d97706)
- **Technology/CS**: Purple (#8b5cf6, #7c3aed)

Ask: "Would you like to use [suggested theme], or would you prefer different colors?"

### 6. POPULATE THE TEMPLATE
For each slide:
- **data-title**: Short, descriptive title (2-5 words)
- **h2**: Main slide heading (can be longer, more descriptive)
- **Content**: Use appropriate elements:
  - `<div class="grid-2">` for side-by-side comparisons
  - `<ul>` or `<ol>` for lists
  - `<p>` for explanatory paragraphs
  - `<h3>` for subsections within a slide
  - `<div class="callout">` for important notes, tips, or key takeaways
  - `<details><summary>` for questions with hidden answers
  - `<p class="eq">` for formulas, code, or technical notation

### 7. WRITING STYLE
- **Clear and concise**: Get to the point quickly
- **Educational tone**: Professional but accessible
- **Bullet points**: Use for lists of concepts, not long paragraphs
- **Bold key terms**: Emphasize definitions and important concepts
- **Callouts**: Use for memorable insights, warnings, or connections
- **Progressive disclosure**: Build from simple to complex

### 8. QUALITY CHECKS
Before finalizing, ensure:
- ✅ All major concepts from source content are covered
- ✅ Slides flow logically and build on each other
- ✅ Terminology is consistent throughout
- ✅ Each slide has clear purpose and isn't overcrowded
- ✅ Questions (if included) have complete answers
- ✅ Summary ties everything together effectively
- ✅ Title and slide titles accurately reflect content

## Output Format

Provide:
1. **Brief analysis** (2-3 sentences) of the content structure you chose and why
2. **Suggested color theme** with hex codes
3. **Complete HTML file** with all content populated
