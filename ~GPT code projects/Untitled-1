41	What does electrical power quantify in a circuit?	The rate of energy transfer (joules per second)	The amount of charge stored	The resistance of a device	The voltage difference only	20	1
42	According to P = V × I, if voltage stays the same and current increases, power:	Increases	Decreases	Stays the same	Becomes zero	20	1
43	An appliance’s power rating (e.g., 2400 W) primarily indicates:	Its maximum rate of energy transformation	Its total energy stored	Its absolute voltage	Its internal resistance	20	1
44	Your electricity bill charges you for:	Energy consumed (kWh)	Average current (A)	Maximum voltage (V)	Peak resistance (Ω)	20	1
45	Which statement about a kilowatt-hour (kWh) is correct?	It is a unit of energy equal to the energy used by a 1000-W device for one hour	It is a unit of power equal to 1000 W	It measures electric charge	It measures voltage drop in one hour	20	1
46	A 10-W LED giving the same light as a 60-W incandescent demonstrates that:	Less power can produce the same useful output	If power is lower, energy use must be higher	Light output depends only on voltage	Incandescent bulbs are more energy-efficient	20	1
47	Why do circuit breakers trip on household circuits?	To interrupt current when it exceeds safe limits and prevent overheating	To increase the voltage during surges	To store extra energy during peaks	To reverse the current direction	20	1
48	In a series circuit carrying the same current through all components, the component with higher resistance:	Dissipates more power	Dissipates less power	Has zero voltage drop	Draws more current than the others	20	1
49	In a parallel circuit with the same voltage across each branch, the branch with lower resistance:	Draws more current and consumes more power	Draws less current and less power	Has zero current	Has the same power as higher resistance branches	20	1
50	Why do many electronic devices include power supplies that convert AC to DC?	Their internal electronic circuits require DC to operate	DC is only used for lighting	AC and DC are identical inside devices	Converting AC to DC increases information content	20	1
51	A key difference between electric power circuits and electronic circuits is that electronic circuits mainly:	Process information using voltage levels	Maximize energy transfer at all times	Use only AC power	Eliminate resistance effects	20	1
52	In digital electronics, information is typically represented as:	High voltage = 1, low voltage = 0	High current = 1, low current = 0	Frequency only	Resistance only	20	1
53	Why do processors operate at low voltages and small currents per transistor?	To minimize power/heat so they can switch very quickly	To eliminate the need for conductors	To prevent electrons from moving	To increase total circuit resistance	20	1
54	The fundamental physics of electric and electronic circuits are:	The same (charge, fields, resistance), applied to different design goals	Different for each type	Opposite in effect	Unrelated to electrons	20	1
55	In an electric vehicle, which pairing is correct?	Electric circuits deliver power; electronic circuits control and make decisions	Electronic circuits deliver motor power; electric circuits process data	Both types only process data	Neither type is required	20	1
56	Household AC reverses polarity 50 times per second. Devices still operate continuously because:	Energy transfer is continuous even though voltage direction reverses	Current stops during each reversal	Voltage becomes DC inside the wall	Resistance becomes zero at 50 Hz	20	1
57	Why do real installations combine series and parallel sections?	To provide both control (switching/protection) and distribution to multiple loads	To cancel resistance exactly	Because pure parallel cannot carry current	To reduce voltage to zero	20	1
58	A basic voltage divider is useful for sensors because it:	Converts a changing resistance into a measurable voltage ratio	Eliminates the need for a power source	Stores charge like a battery	Produces constant current regardless of load	20	1
59	What does a comparator circuit do?	Outputs a high or low state depending on whether input voltage is above or below a threshold	Measures current directly	Stores energy like a capacitor	Reverses AC to DC automatically	20	1
60	In a darkness-activated LDR buzzer, covering the LDR typically:	Increases LDR resistance, raises divider output, and crosses the threshold to turn the buzzer on	Decreases LDR resistance and turns the buzzer on	Lowers the divider voltage below any threshold	Stops the comparator from operating	20	1
