apply physics understanding to justify a stance, opinion or solution to the selected issue or application.
Option 2.17: How does physics explain the origins of matter?
In this option students focus on communicating physics understanding in the context of theories that explain the origins of matter. In preparing their communication related to a selected contemporary societal issue or application, students explore the nature of matter, and consider the origins of atoms, time and space. They examine the currently accepted scientific theory of the origins of the Universe and the Standard Model to explain how matter has changed over time. Contexts for student exploration can include: the limitations of models used to explain the origins of matter; the process of the discovery of cosmic background radiation; evaluation of current and proposed future directions of theories related to knowledge about the origins of the Universe; investigation of the nature of the development of scientific knowledge, from predicting the existence of a particle from theory through to building technology and the subsequent discovery of the particle; or an investigation into the nature of collaboration and relationships between countries in the pursuit of scientific knowledge.
 
Key knowledge
The physics of the origins of matter
describe the Big Bang as a currently held theory that explains the origins of both time and space, and evaluate evidence for the Big Bang including the identification of cosmic background radiation 
explain the changes of matter during the different stages of the Universe over time due to expansion and cooling
relate predictions to the subsequent discoveries of the neutron, neutrino, positron and Higgs boson
compare the nature of leptons, hadrons, mesons and baryons
explain that for every elementary matter particle there exists an antimatter particle of equal mass and opposite charge, and that if a particle and its antiparticle come into contact the particles will annihilate each other to create radiation
describe the contribution that the detection of gravitational waves has made to understanding of the Universe
Communicating physics
evaluate validity of sources of information 
apply physics concepts specific to the investigation: definitions of key terms; and use of appropriate scientific terminology, conventions and representations 
apply the use of data representations, models and theories in organising and explaining observed phenomena and physics concepts, and discuss the limitations of the explanations
discuss the influence of sociocultural, economic, legal and political factors relevant to the selected issue or application
apply physics understanding to justify a stance, opinion or solution to the selected issue or application.
Option 2.18: How is contemporary physics research being conducted in our region?
In this option students focus on communicating physics understanding in the context of cutting-edge research that is based in Victoria, Australia or Oceania. In preparing their communication related to a selected contemporary societal issue or application, students investigate how research involves both individual and collaborative endeavours, as well as the application of critical and creative thinking. They identify key physics concepts to provide a physics-related response to their chosen area of physics research. They research and analyse the limitations, challenges and consequences of local contemporary physics research. Contexts for student exploration can include: research at the Australian Synchrotron; space research; dark matter research; medical research involving radiation; materials research; or nuclear fusion research.
Key knowledge
The physics of local scientific research
investigate cutting-edge research that is based in Victoria, Australia or Oceania
select one area of local physics research and follow protocols to access information related to current research in the selected area
identify the physics related to the chosen research
explain how physics understanding has led to the development of the selected research
explain how critical and creative thinking shapes the application of physics concepts related to the selected research
analyse the extent to which both individual contribution and collaboration are involved in the selected research 
evaluate how the chosen physics research may change the way we live
