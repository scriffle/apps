            <p>"Hello, today we're exploring the story of Coolwater Limestone, a rock that holds the secrets of an ancient Australian ocean. Formed around 350 million years ago, this rock isn't just a stone; it's a time capsule. Let's journey back to see how it was made, what it's made of, and how it connects to our lives today."</p>

            <p><strong>Narration Script:</strong></p>
            <p>"Coolwater Limestone is a **sedimentary rock**, specifically a bioclastic limestone. 'Bio' means life, and 'clastic' means made of fragments. As you can see here, it's packed with the fossilised fragments of ancient sea creatures. [Point to fossils in the image]. It's typically light to dark grey. Under a microscope, like in this thin-section view [point to thin-section], you can clearly see the calcite crystals and the ghostly outlines of organisms that make up the rock's texture."</p>

            <p><strong>Narration Script:</strong></p>
            <p>"This rock formed in Earth's crust, at the bottom of a shallow, warm sea that covered parts of eastern Australia during the Carboniferous period. Over millions of years, the shells and skeletons of marine life, like crinoids and brachiopods, rained down on the seafloor. The immense pressure from the water above and overlying sediments compacted these fragments, and minerals like calcite cemented them together to form solid limestone."</p>

            <p><strong>Narration Script:</strong></p>
            <p>"The most powerful evidence of its history is right in the rock itself. These circular and tube-like shapes [point to crinoid fossils] are the fossilised stems of crinoids, also known as 'sea lilies'. The presence of these fossils, along with corals and brachiopods, proves this rock formed in a bustling marine ecosystem. The primary mineral is calcium carbonate ($CaCO_3$), the same chemical that makes up seashells today."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="narration-script">
            <p><strong>Narration Script:</strong></p>
            <p>"Like any rock, Coolwater Limestone is on a constant journey. Exposed at the surface, it can be weathered by rain, which is naturally slightly acidic, dissolving it into particles. These can be transported by rivers and deposited as new sediment. If the limestone is buried deep within the crust and subjected to intense heat and pressure [point to metamorphism on diagram], it doesn't melt, but recrystallizes to become a beautiful metamorphic rock: **marble**. Tectonic forces can then uplift it, and the cycle begins again."</p>

            <p>"In Australia, Coolwater Limestone is found in the New England region of New South Wales, especially around Barrington Tops National Park. These rocks are part of a geological feature called the New England Orogen. Similar Carboniferous-aged limestones, formed in the same way, are found all over the world, such as the Peak District in the UK and in parts of the central United States."</p>

            <p>"This ancient rock is vital to our modern world. Its key property is its high calcium carbonate content. When heated, limestone produces lime, which is the key ingredient in **cement**. It’s also crushed to make **aggregate** for roads and concrete. Its durability and appearance sometimes allow it to be cut into blocks, called 'dimension stone', for buildings. From ancient seabeds to our modern cities, this rock builds our world."</p>
