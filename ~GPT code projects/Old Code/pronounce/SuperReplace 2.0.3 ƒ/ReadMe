About SuperReplace 2.0.3  +  Release Note<1998.12.16>Why?There are many text file formats in the world of computers, and we often need to convert one format into another. Usually it simply means replacing one string by another. Of course some text editors provide this possibility with Find and Replace… commands. But with those commands it is almost impossible to perform a complicated multi-replacement conversion. What Is It?SuperReplace is a powerful application for creating text conversion utilities, called "Filters". The syntax of filter is very easy to understand. In particular, SuperReplace can be used for- reformating HTML files, - converting text between PC Window/Mac/Unix formats, - converting text between TeX 7 bits and TeX 8 bits , - extracting a few lines in text files,- selecting a few columns in multi-columns text files,- converting database files between two different formats,- removing accent letters.Features- High conversion speed,- Easy to use,- True copy/paste support,- Full variables support,- An assistant helps you to edit filter. How to Use It? A Simple ExampleTo create a filter who replaces é by &eacute; and à by &agrave; follow these steps:    (1) Launch SuperReplace application.    (2) Write the following lines in the window "untitled":           "é"      "&eacute;"           "à"      "&agrave;"   (3) Save the filter. To use the filter for your conversion, select your text files or folders under Finder, drag and drop them onto the filter icon. That's all. Normally the output files named"xxxxx.New" have been created in the same folder as the input files "xxxxx". Documentation & Help- Using Manual.
