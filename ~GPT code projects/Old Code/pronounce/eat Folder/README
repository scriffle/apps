eat.1 - troff -man form of the manual.

eat.doc - ascii form of the manual.

eatindex.c - C program to generate ".index" files from ".concise"
and ".heads" files. The program must be compiled. The location of
the relevant files must be entered in the #define statements at the top of
the file. 

eatshow.c - C program to find associations in the thesaurus from the
".concise" and ".index" files. The program must be compiled. The location of
the relevant files must be entered in the #define statements at the top of
the file. 

rs.concise - the association file indexed by responses.

rs.heads - the header words in "rs.concise" with the total number 
of stimuli which produce the response and the total number of times
the response was produced. This file is used to generate the ".index"
files but is not required to use the thesaurus itself.

rs.index - the index file to "rs.concise" generated from it and "rs.heads"
by eatindex.c. The index file is used by eatshow.c.

sr.concise - the association file indexed by stimuli.

sr.heads - the header words in "sr.concise", otherwise like "rs.heads".

sr.index - the index file to "sr.concise" generated from it and "sr.heads"
by eatindex.c. The index file is used by eatshow.c.

To use the thesaurus:

1) copy the tape to a disk dirrectory with enough space using: 
	tar -xv *
It may be necessary to state the tape device also for your site.

2) edit the .c program #define file locations to reflect the location
of the association files at your site.

3) compile  eatshow.c  and move the executable to a public location.

4) if it works the ".heads" files and eatindex.c can be deleted. Otherwise 
it may be necessary to compile and run eatindex to produce new index 
files from them.
