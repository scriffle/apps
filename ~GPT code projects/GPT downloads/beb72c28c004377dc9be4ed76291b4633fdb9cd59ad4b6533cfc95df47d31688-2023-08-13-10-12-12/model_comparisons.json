First, we need to know the chemical equation:\n\nFe\u2082O\u2083 + 2Al \u2192 2Fe + Al\u2082O\u2083\n\nTo find the correct ratio, we need to use the mole concept. A mole is like a possum-sized bunch of particles, and it helps us count and measure things in chemistry.\n\nNow, let's rustle up some numbers. The molar mass of Aluminum (Al) is about 27 g/mol, and for Iron oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083) it's about 160 g/mol. To find the ratio, we'll use the coefficients from the equation: 1 mole of Fe\u2082O\u2083 reacts with 2 moles of Al.\n\nSo, let's scurry on and divide the molar mass by the coefficients:\n\nAl: 27 g/mol \u00f7 2 = 13.5 g\nFe\u2082O\u2083: 160 g/mol \u00f7 1 = 160 g\n\nFinally, divide the molar mass of Fe\u2082O\u2083 by the molar mass of Al:\n\n160 g \u00f7 13.5 g \u2248 11.9\n\nSo for a complete thermite reaction, Flossie, you'll need about 1 part Aluminum to 12 parts Iron oxide (1:12). If you want to use a 1:3 ratio, you could use 1 part Aluminum to 3 parts Iron oxide, but the reaction won't be as complete.

It helps us measure stuff in chemistry, just like a dozen helps with eggs.\n\nNow, the aluminium (Al) and iron oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083) need to be in the right ratio for the reaction to happen completely. Let's see how many moles we need of each. Al weighs 27 g/mol, and Fe\u2082O\u2083 weighs 160 g/mol (2 irons and 3 oxygens).\n\nIn the equation, we need 1 mole of Al for 1 mole of Fe\u2082O\u2083. So, we'll compare their weights: 27 g Al and 160 g Fe\u2082O\u2083.\n\nDivide both weights by Al's weight (27 g):\n1 g Al / 27 g Al = 1 mol Al\n160 g Fe\u2082O\u2083 / 27 g Al \u2248 6 mol Fe\u2082O\u2083\n\nWe see that 1 mole of Al reacts with 6 moles of Fe\u2082O\u2083. But we've got 2 Fe atoms in Fe\u2082O\u2083, so the ratio is really 1:3 (Al:Fe).\n\nSo Flossie, just remember the simple ratio: 1 part Al to 3 parts Fe (by moles) for a complete thermite reaction.
