Pure gold has only gold atoms. But most things we see every day are mixtures.\n\nMixtures have two or more different things mixed together. When you make cordial, you mix cordial powder with water. The powder dissolves and spreads out evenly. This is called a homogeneous mixture because it looks the same everywhere.\n\nOther mixtures are heterogeneous. This means you can see the different parts. If you put sand in water, you can still see the sand grains. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have used their knowledge of mixtures for thousands of years. They developed clever ways to separate useful things from plants and the land.\n\nWe can separate mixtures by using the different properties of each part. If one part is bigger, we use filtration. If we want to get back a dissolved solid, we use evaporation. Other methods include using magnets to pull out magnetic materials and letting heavier things sink to the bottom."

First, workers let the water sit so heavy dirt sinks to the bottom. They carefully pour off the cleaner water on top (decantation). Next, they pass the water through filters with tiny holes to catch small bits. For water with too much salt, they use distillation.",

If you dissolve salt in water, the salt particles spread evenly between the water molecules. Heterogeneous mixtures have visible differences in composition. Sand mixed with pebbles clearly shows two different components.\n\nSolutions have special terms based on how much solute is present. A dilute solution has relatively little solute. A concentrated solution has a lot of solute. A saturated solution contains the maximum amount that can dissolve at that temperature. A supersaturated solution contains more than this - it's unstable and crystals may form suddenly.\n\nSeparation techniques exploit differences between components. Filtration works when particle sizes differ. Evaporation and distillation work when boiling points differ. Magnetic separation works when one component is magnetic.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have used separation techniques for thousands of years. Yandying uses swirling water to separate heavier gold from lighter sand. Winnowing uses wind to separate grain from chaff. These techniques represent millennia of systematic observation."

If you dissolve salt in water, the salt particles spread evenly between the water molecules. Heterogeneous mixtures have visible differences in composition. Sand mixed with pebbles clearly shows two different components.\n\nSolutions have special terms based on how much solute is present. A dilute solution has relatively little solute. A concentrated solution has a lot of solute. A saturated solution contains the maximum amount that can dissolve at that temperature. A supersaturated solution contains more than this - it's unstable and crystals may form suddenly.\n\nSeparation techniques exploit differences between components. Filtration works when particle sizes differ. Evaporation and distillation work when boiling points differ. Magnetic separation works when one component is magnetic.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have used separation techniques for thousands of years. Yandying uses swirling water to separate heavier gold from lighter sand. Winnowing uses wind to separate grain from chaff. These techniques represent millennia of systematic observation."

If you dissolve salt in water, the salt particles spread evenly between the water molecules. Heterogeneous mixtures have visible differences in composition. Sand mixed with pebbles clearly shows two different components.\n\nSolutions have special terms based on how much solute is present. A dilute solution has relatively little solute. A concentrated solution has a lot of solute. A saturated solution contains the maximum amount that can dissolve at that temperature. A supersaturated solution contains more than this - it's unstable and crystals may form suddenly.\n\nSeparation techniques exploit differences between components. Filtration works when particle sizes differ. Evaporation and distillation work when boiling points differ. Magnetic separation works when one component is magnetic.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have used separation techniques for thousands of years. Yandying uses swirling water to separate heavier gold from lighter sand. Winnowing uses wind to separate grain from chaff. These techniques represent millennia of systematic observation."

If you dissolve salt in water, the salt particles spread evenly between the water molecules. Heterogeneous mixtures have visible differences in composition. Sand mixed with pebbles clearly shows two different components.\n\nSolutions have special terms based on how much solute is present. A dilute solution has relatively little solute. A concentrated solution has a lot of solute. A saturated solution contains the maximum amount that can dissolve at that temperature. A supersaturated solution contains more than this - it's unstable and crystals may form suddenly.\n\nSeparation techniques exploit differences between components. Filtration works when particle sizes differ. Evaporation and distillation work when boiling points differ. Magnetic separation works when one component is magnetic.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have used separation techniques for thousands of years. Yandying uses swirling water to separate heavier gold from lighter sand. Winnowing uses wind to separate grain from chaff. These techniques represent millennia of systematic observation."
