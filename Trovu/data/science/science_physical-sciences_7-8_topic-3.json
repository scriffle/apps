Gravitational potential energy depends on height, elastic potential energy is in stretched materials, and chemical potential energy is stored in molecular bonds.\n\nEnergy transforms constantly. In a roller-coaster, gravitational potential at the top becomes kinetic energy as the cart speeds down, then back to potential as it climbs. A Newton's cradle shows similar transformations. In all cases, the total energy stays the same, but some becomes heat through friction.\n\nHeat transfers through three mechanisms: conduction (through direct contact), convection (through moving fluids like air or water), and radiation (through electromagnetic waves like sunlight).\n\nNo machine is 100% efficient because some energy always becomes dispersed thermal energy. Sankey diagrams help visualise this\u2014arrow widths show how much energy flows where, making efficiency easy to see.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples developed sophisticated fire-starting methods that transform kinetic energy to thermal energy through friction. The fire drill, fire plough, fire saw, and percussion methods each demonstrate deep understanding of energy transformation."

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion\u2014the faster and heavier an object, the more kinetic energy it has. Potential energy is stored energy waiting to be used. Gravitational potential energy depends on height, elastic potential energy is in stretched materials, and chemical potential energy is stored in molecular bonds.\n\nEnergy transforms constantly. In a roller-coaster, gravitational potential at the top becomes kinetic energy as the cart speeds down, then back to potential as it climbs. A Newton's cradle shows similar transformations. In all cases, the total energy stays the same, but some becomes heat through friction.\n\nHeat transfers through three mechanisms: conduction (through direct contact), convection (through moving fluids like air or water), and radiation (through electromagnetic waves like sunlight).\n\nNo machine is 100% efficient because some energy always becomes dispersed thermal energy. Sankey diagrams help visualise this\u2014arrow widths show how much energy flows where, making efficiency easy to see.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples developed sophisticated fire-starting methods that transform kinetic energy to thermal energy through friction. The fire drill, fire plough, fire saw, and percussion methods each demonstrate deep understanding of energy transformation."

In all cases, the total energy stays the same, but some becomes heat through friction.\n\nHeat transfers through three mechanisms: conduction (through direct contact), convection (through moving fluids like air or water), and radiation (through electromagnetic waves like sunlight).\n\nNo machine is 100% efficient because some energy always becomes dispersed thermal energy. Sankey diagrams help visualise this\u2014arrow widths show how much energy flows where, making efficiency easy to see.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples developed sophisticated fire-starting methods that transform kinetic energy to thermal energy through friction.

Gravitational potential energy depends on height, elastic potential energy is in stretched materials, and chemical potential energy is stored in molecular bonds.\n\nEnergy transforms constantly. In a roller-coaster, gravitational potential at the top becomes kinetic energy as the cart speeds down, then back to potential as it climbs. A Newton's cradle shows similar transformations. In all cases, the total energy stays the same, but some becomes heat through friction.\n\nHeat transfers through three mechanisms: conduction (through direct contact), convection (through moving fluids like air or water), and radiation (through electromagnetic waves like sunlight).\n\nNo machine is 100% efficient because some energy always becomes dispersed thermal energy. Sankey diagrams help visualise this\u2014arrow widths show how much energy flows where, making efficiency easy to see.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples developed sophisticated fire-starting methods that transform kinetic energy to thermal energy through friction. The fire drill, fire plough, fire saw, and percussion methods each demonstrate deep understanding of energy transformation."
