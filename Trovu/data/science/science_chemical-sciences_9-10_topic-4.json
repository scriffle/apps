        "introduction": "Have you ever tasted a lemon and noticed its sour taste? Or felt how slippery soap is? These everyday experiences introduce us to acids and bases—two important types of chemicals. Acids and bases are all around us, from the food we eat to the cleaning products in our homes. Understanding acids and bases helps us stay safe, cook better food, and understand how our bodies work. Scientists have created the pH scale to measure how acidic or basic substances are, helping us use these chemicals safely and effectively.",
        "keyPoints": [
          {
            "point": "Acids have distinct properties",
            "explanation": "Acids have several properties that help us identify them. They taste sour (like lemons, vinegar, or citrus fruits). They can corrode or dissolve metals—this is why acidic drinks can damage tooth enamel over time. Strong acids are dangerous and can burn skin, which is why we never taste chemicals in the laboratory. Acids turn blue litmus paper red, which is a safe way to test for acids without tasting them."
          },
          {
            "point": "Bases have their own properties",
            "explanation": "Bases (also called alkalis when dissolved in water) have different properties from acids. They taste bitter and feel slippery or soapy when you touch them—soap itself is a mild base. Like strong acids, strong bases are dangerous and can burn skin. Bases turn red litmus paper blue, the opposite of what acids do. Common household bases include baking soda, soap, and cleaning products like bleach."
          },
          {
            "point": "The pH scale measures acidity and basicity",
            "explanation": "The pH scale goes from 0 to 14 and tells us how acidic or basic something is. A pH of 7 is neutral—not acidic or basic. Water has a pH of 7. Numbers below 7 are acidic—the lower the number, the stronger the acid. Battery acid has a pH around 0. Numbers above 7 are basic—the higher the number, the stronger the base. Drain cleaner can have a pH of 14. Most things we encounter daily are between pH 3 and pH 11."
          },
          {
            "point": "Indicators show whether something is acidic or basic",
            "explanation": "Indicators are substances that change colour depending on pH. Litmus paper is a common indicator—it turns red in acid and blue in base. Universal indicator is even more useful because it turns different colours at different pH levels, showing the whole rainbow from red (very acidic) through green (neutral) to purple (very basic). Some natural substances, like red cabbage juice, can also work as indicators."
          },
          {
            "point": "Neutralisation happens when acids and bases mix",
            "explanation": "When an acid and a base are mixed together, they neutralise each other. This means the acid becomes less acidic and the base becomes less basic. If you mix them in the right amounts, you end up with something neutral, like salt water. This is useful—when you have an upset stomach from too much acid, antacid tablets (which are bases) neutralise the acid and help you feel better."

        ],
        "conceptExplanation": "Acids and bases are everywhere in our daily lives. The food we eat contains acids—citrus fruits, tomatoes, and vinegar are all acidic. Many cleaning products are bases, which is why they feel slippery. Our stomach uses acid to digest food, and our blood is slightly basic to help our cells work properly. The pH scale gives us a simple number to describe how acidic or basic something is. When acids and bases meet, they react in neutralisation—each makes the other weaker. This is useful for treating acid reflux, cleaning up acid spills, and even in cooking when we add baking soda to acidic batters."

His mum gives him a chewable antacid tablet containing magnesium hydroxide (a base). Within 15 minutes, Jayden feels better. The antacid neutralised the excess stomach acid.",

          "Why does Jayden feel better after taking the antacid?"
        ],
        "realWorldConnection": "Millions of Australians experience heartburn and use antacids to relieve symptoms. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples traditionally used various plant medicines for digestive complaints, though the chemistry wasn't understood at the time. Today, understanding acid-base chemistry helps pharmaceutical companies create effective medicines. Antacids are just one example of neutralisation helping people—farmers also add lime (a base) to acidic soils to help crops grow better, and water treatment plants adjust pH to make drinking water safe.",
        "modelAnalysis": "This case demonstrates practical neutralisation. Stomach acid (hydrochloric acid, HCl) has a pH around 1-2, which is very acidic—necessary for digestion but painful if too much is produced or it reaches the throat. The antacid contains a base (magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)₂). When they react: acid + base → salt + water. The products are less irritating than the excess acid, so the burning sensation stops. The reaction is: 2HCl + Mg(OH)₂ → MgCl₂ + 2H₂O. This neutralisation demonstrates how understanding pH and acid-base reactions has practical health applications."

If the pH is too low (acidic), it can irritate swimmers' eyes and skin, corrode pool equipment, and damage pool surfaces. If the pH is too high (basic), chlorine disinfectant works less effectively, water becomes cloudy, and scaling can form on surfaces. Pool managers regularly test pH and add acids or bases to maintain the correct balance. This shows how acid-base chemistry has practical applications in keeping people safe and comfortable."

This neutralisation reaction has many practical applications: antacids neutralise stomach acid, lime neutralises acidic soil, and industrial processes treat acidic waste water. Understanding acid-base chemistry is essential for medicine, agriculture, environmental science, and many industrial processes."

Engineers calculate how much lime is needed based on the amount of acid produced—a direct application of quantitative acid-base chemistry to solve real-world environmental problems.",

When iron sulfide (FeS₂) is exposed to oxygen and water, it oxidises: Iron sulfide + Oxygen + Water → Sulfuric acid + Iron hydroxide. The sulfuric acid dramatically lowers soil pH. Neutralisation uses calcium hydroxide (lime): Sulfuric acid + Calcium hydroxide → Calcium sulfate + Water (H₂SO₄ + Ca(OH)₂ → CaSO₄ + 2H₂O). The amount of lime needed depends on the quantity of acid—calculated using molar relationships. This shows how acid-base chemistry is essential for environmental protection and sustainable development."

Weak acids only partially dissociate—in 0.1 M CH₃COOH, only about 1% dissociates, so [H⁺] ≈ 0.001 M. Electrical conductivity depends on ion concentration. With more ions per unit volume, strong acids conduct electricity better. This is also why strong acids have lower pH than weak acids at the same concentration."

Salt hydrolysis—the reaction of salt ions with water—explains why sodium acetate is basic and ammonium chloride is acidic. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation efficiently describes buffer pH.

Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal coastal communities have managed reef resources for tens of thousands of years and now face unprecedented changes. The chemistry is inescapable: as atmospheric CO₂ increases, oceans absorb about 30% of it, and the carbonate equilibria shift. Even though the ocean has an enormous buffer capacity (vast amounts of dissolved carbonate), the rate of CO₂ addition exceeds the buffer's ability to maintain pH. Research at Australian marine stations quantifies these changes, informing climate policy.

Adding CO₂ shifts all equilibria to the right, producing more H⁺ (acidification). The apparent paradox is that the ocean is a buffer but is still acidifying. Resolution: buffer capacity is finite. The ocean absorbs ~2.4 Gt C/year as CO₂, but equilibrating this with the deep ocean (where most carbonate resides) takes centuries. Surface waters, where corals live, acidify faster than mixing can replenish buffer capacity. The 0.1 pH unit drop corresponds to [H⁺] increasing from 10⁻⁸·² to 10⁻⁸·¹ M, a factor of 10⁰·¹ ≈ 1.26 or 26% increase. This shifts the HCO₃⁻/CO₃²⁻ equilibrium toward HCO₃⁻, reducing [CO₃²⁻] needed for calcification.

By Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 6.1 + log([HCO₃⁻]/[H₂CO₃]) = 6.1 + log(25mM/1.25mM) = 6.1 + 1.3 = 7.4. This open buffer system is unique: CO₂ is regulated by respiration (adjusting [H₂CO₃]) and HCO₃⁻ by kidneys. When acid is added, HCO₃⁻ neutralises it → H₂CO₃ → CO₂ (exhaled). Phosphate and protein buffers provide additional capacity. Haemoglobin is amphoteric, buffering within red blood cells. Limits: overwhelming acid production (diabetic ketoacidosis) exceeds buffer capacity. Respiratory failure prevents CO₂ removal. Kidney disease impairs HCO₃⁻ regeneration. The system handles normal variation but fails with pathological acid loads or organ dysfunction."

In concentrated or ionic solutions, interactions between species mean actual behaviour differs from ideal. Activity (a) = γ × C, where γ is the activity coefficient. The thermodynamic Ka = aH⁺ × aA⁻/aHA. In seawater (ionic strength ~0.7 M), γ for H⁺ ≈ 0.7, so measured pH differs from -log[H⁺].

In non-polar solvents, HCl barely dissociates because ions aren't stabilised. Conversely, some acids are stronger in DMSO than in water—water stabilises the conjugate base through hydrogen bonding.

Indigenous communities near refineries have legitimate concerns about chemical safety, driving development of safer solid catalysts. This case shows how fundamental acid-base concepts (What makes an acid strong?) extend to transformative industrial applications through the extreme conditions of superacids.",
        "modelAnalysis": "The chemistry centres on the thermodynamics and kinetics of protonation. C-H bonds in alkanes have no lone pairs—they are among the weakest bases known. Protonating them requires acids with H₀ below -12 (superacidic). The conjugate acids of superacids (like SbF₆⁻) are exceptionally weak bases—they don't compete for protons. This 'non-coordinating' nature allows all proton donation power to be available for reaction. Once the alkane is protonated, a carbocation forms that can rearrange: the linear structure converts to branched, releasing a proton and regenerating the catalyst. The process works because branched carbocations are more stable than linear ones (hyperconjugation). Understanding this required extending acid-base concepts beyond aqueous solution—the Hammett acidity function provides the framework for quantifying acidity where pH is meaningless."
