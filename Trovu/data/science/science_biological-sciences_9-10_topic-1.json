The nucleus contains DNA, which looks like a twisted ladder. This shape is called a double helix.\n\nDNA carries information in a code. Different parts of the DNA code for different things. These sections are called genes. You have genes for eye colour, hair colour, how tall you might grow, and thousands of other features.\n\nWhen parents have children, they pass on their DNA. You got half your DNA from your biological mother and half from your biological father. This is why you might look a bit like both of them, but not exactly like either one.\n\nSome traits are dominant, which means they show up more easily. Other traits are recessive, which means they are hidden unless you get them from both parents. For example, brown eyes are often dominant over blue eyes.\n\nFirst Nations Australians have understood for thousands of years that features are passed from parents to children. They used this knowledge to breed plants and animals with useful traits. Today, scientists use genetics in medicine, farming, and many other areas."

Surprisingly, one of the puppies, called Patches, has curly fur!\n\nMia is confused. 'How can Patches have curly fur when both parents have straight fur?' she asks her science teacher.\n\nHer teacher explains that both Buster and Rosie must carry a hidden gene for curly fur. Even though the straight fur gene is dominant (it shows), they each have one recessive curly fur gene that they don't show. When Patches inherited the curly gene from both parents, the curly trait appeared.\n\nMia's teacher draws a Punnett square to show how this works. Using S for straight (dominant) and s for curly (recessive), both parents are Ss. The Punnett square shows that one in four puppies could be ss (curly).",

The DNA molecule looks like a twisted ladder, called a double helix. The sides of the ladder are made of alternating sugar and phosphate molecules. The rungs are made of pairs of bases.\n\nThere are four bases in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). These bases always pair in a specific way: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. This is called complementary base pairing.\n\nGenes are sections of DNA that contain instructions for making proteins. Proteins carry out most of the work in cells and determine many of our traits. Different versions of the same gene are called alleles. For example, there might be an allele for brown eyes and an allele for blue eyes.\n\nWhen organisms reproduce, they pass on their alleles to their offspring. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. The combination of alleles is called the genotype. The physical characteristic that results is called the phenotype. Some alleles are dominant, meaning they show their effect even when paired with a different allele. Recessive alleles only show their effect when two copies are present.\n\nPunnett squares are tools that help predict the possible combinations of alleles in offspring. By understanding these patterns, scientists can predict the likelihood of certain traits appearing in the next generation."

The team collected seeds and took cuttings from different trees to grow new plants. They carefully tracked which plants came from which parent trees to maintain genetic diversity.\n\nHowever, they discovered a problem: all wild Wollemi Pines are genetically very similar, likely due to past population bottlenecks. This low genetic diversity means the species is vulnerable to diseases—if one tree is susceptible, they probably all are.\n\nThe team now works to protect the wild population from disease while growing diverse collections in botanical gardens around Australia.",

Its structure—the double helix—was first described in 1953, though Rosalind Franklin's X-ray crystallography work was crucial to this discovery. The DNA molecule consists of two strands wound around each other, connected by paired bases.\n\nEach strand is made of nucleotides, which have three components: a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine). The sugars and phosphates form the 'backbone' of the strand. The bases face inward and pair with bases on the opposite strand: adenine always pairs with thymine (A-T), and guanine always pairs with cytosine (G-C). This complementary base pairing is crucial for DNA replication—when cells divide, each strand serves as a template for building a new complementary strand.\n\nGenes are specific sequences of DNA bases that contain instructions for making proteins. The sequence of bases (the genetic code) determines which amino acids are joined together to form a protein. Proteins carry out most of the work in cells and are responsible for many traits. For example, proteins determine eye colour, blood type, and enzyme function.\n\nOrganisms inherit alleles (versions of genes) from their parents. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. The combination of alleles (genotype) determines the trait that is expressed (phenotype). Punnett squares help predict the probability of different genotypes and phenotypes in offspring.\n\nGenetic variation—differences in DNA between individuals—arises through several mechanisms. Mutations are random changes to DNA sequences. Sexual reproduction combines alleles from two parents in new combinations. Independent assortment during meiosis creates further variation. This genetic variation is the raw material for natural selection and evolution."

        "conceptExplanation": "The central dogma of molecular biology describes how genetic information is expressed. DNA stores genetic information in the sequence of bases along its strands. During transcription, one strand of DNA serves as a template for synthesising messenger RNA (mRNA). RNA polymerase reads the DNA and builds a complementary mRNA strand using RNA nucleotides (with uracil replacing thymine). The mRNA then moves to ribosomes, where translation occurs.\n\nDuring translation, the mRNA sequence is read in groups of three bases called codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid (or a stop signal). Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome, where they are joined together to form a protein chain. The sequence of codons in mRNA determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein, which determines the protein's structure and function.\n\nMendel's laws describe inheritance patterns. The law of segregation states that organisms have two alleles for each gene, and these separate during gamete formation so each gamete receives one allele. The law of independent assortment states that genes for different traits segregate independently (when on different chromosomes).\n\nHowever, not all inheritance follows simple Mendelian patterns. In incomplete dominance, heterozygotes show an intermediate phenotype (e.g., red × white = pink flowers). In codominance, both alleles are fully expressed (e.g., AB blood type). Sex-linked traits are carried on sex chromosomes and show different inheritance patterns in males and females.\n\nGenetic technologies now allow us to read (sequencing), edit (CRISPR), and transfer (genetic engineering) genetic information. These technologies have applications in medicine (gene therapy, genetic testing), agriculture (GM crops), and conservation (genetic rescue of endangered species). Understanding the science behind these technologies is essential for evaluating their benefits and risks."

The tiny population faces extinction partly due to genetic problems resulting from inbreeding.\n\nDr. Catherine Grueber from the University of Sydney leads genetic research to save the species. Her team uses DNA analysis to measure genetic diversity in the population and identify the most genetically valuable individuals for breeding programs. They found that the wild population has very low genetic diversity—many individuals are as related as siblings.\n\nThe team developed a 'genetic rescue' strategy. They identified captive birds with rare alleles (genetic variations) and prioritised these for release to the wild population. They also use genetic matching to pair breeding birds to minimise inbreeding and maintain what genetic diversity remains.\n\nThe work extends beyond genetics: understanding which genes affect survival helps identify habitat requirements and inform broader conservation strategies.

        "conceptExplanation": "The relationship between genotype and phenotype is far more complex than simple Mendelian ratios suggest. Gene expression—the process by which genetic information produces functional products—is regulated at multiple levels, allowing the same genome to produce hundreds of different cell types in a single organism.\n\nTranscriptional regulation determines whether and how much a gene is transcribed. Promoter regions and enhancers control RNA polymerase access to genes. Transcription factors bind to DNA and either activate or repress transcription. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modification, affect chromatin structure and gene accessibility without changing the DNA sequence. Remarkably, some epigenetic modifications can be inherited across generations, challenging traditional views of inheritance.\n\nPost-transcriptional regulation includes alternative splicing (producing different proteins from the same gene), mRNA stability, and microRNA-mediated regulation. Translational and post-translational regulation further modulate protein production and activity.\n\nComplex traits like height, intelligence, and disease susceptibility involve polygenic inheritance—many genes each contributing small effects—combined with environmental influences. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants associated with complex traits, but typically each variant explains only a small fraction of trait variation.\n\nEpistasis adds another layer of complexity: genes interact with each other, such that the effect of one gene depends on the genotype at another locus. For example, coat colour in Labrador dogs involves two genes: one for pigment production and one for pigment deposition. A dog homozygous for the 'no deposition' allele will be yellow regardless of its pigment genotype.\n\nThese insights have profound implications for genetic technologies. The complexity of gene regulation means that genetic modifications may have unexpected effects. Personalised medicine must account for individual genetic variation. Gene editing raises questions about consent, equity, and the boundaries of human intervention in natural processes."

Studies led by Dr. Rachel Yehuda at Mount Sinai Hospital found that children of Holocaust survivors had altered stress hormone profiles compared to control groups—despite never experiencing the trauma themselves.\n\nThe proposed mechanism is epigenetic: severe trauma in parents may cause epigenetic modifications (such as DNA methylation changes in stress-response genes) that are transmitted to offspring through gametes. Similar findings have emerged from studies of famine survivors, traumatic stress, and environmental exposures.\n\nThese findings raise profound questions. If experiences can modify our epigenome in heritable ways, then environmental effects can be 'remembered' across generations—a mechanism beyond traditional Mendelian inheritance. This has implications for understanding health disparities, including the effects of colonisation on Indigenous populations.\n\nHowever, the field remains controversial. Critics note that many studies are small, findings are difficult to replicate, and distinguishing epigenetic effects from social/cultural transmission of trauma is methodologically challenging.",

In Labrador coat colour, gene E controls whether pigment is deposited in fur, while gene B controls whether that pigment is black or brown. A dog with genotype ee cannot deposit any pigment, so it will be yellow regardless of whether it has B or b alleles. The E gene is epistatic to the B gene—it masks or modifies B's effect. This demonstrates that genes interact in pathways: the protein product of one gene may be required for another gene's product to function. Understanding these interactions is essential because they mean phenotypic outcomes cannot be predicted from individual gene effects alone.",

            "modelResponse": "Epigenetic inheritance fundamentally challenges the nature-nurture dichotomy by revealing that environmental experiences can create heritable changes. Traditionally, 'nature' referred to genetic inheritance (DNA sequence) while 'nurture' referred to environmental effects that were not inherited. Epigenetics blurs this boundary: environmental factors (nutrition, stress, toxins) can modify gene expression through DNA methylation and histone modification, and some of these modifications can be transmitted to offspring.\n\nFor heredity, this means that inheritance encompasses more than DNA sequence. A parent's experiences may influence offspring phenotype through epigenetic marks transmitted via gametes. This has been demonstrated in animal studies and suggested in human studies of famine, trauma, and environmental exposures.\n\nFor evolution, epigenetic inheritance provides an additional mechanism for phenotypic change across generations. While natural selection acts primarily on genetic variation, epigenetic variation might allow faster adaptive responses to environmental change. Some argue this represents 'Lamarckian' inheritance of acquired characteristics, though the mechanisms differ from what Lamarck proposed.\n\nFor social policy, the implications are profound. If adversity (poverty, discrimination, trauma) can have transgenerational epigenetic effects, this provides biological support for addressing systemic inequalities. It may help explain health disparities in colonised Indigenous populations. However, there are risks: epigenetic determinism could be misused to blame victims or their ancestors, or to justify eugenic interventions. The science is still developing, and we must be cautious about policy applications before mechanisms are fully understood.",
