When you look through a microscope, you can see that even a tiny drop of pond water is full of living cells!\n\nCells come in different shapes and sizes, but they all have some parts in common. Every cell has a cell membrane on the outside. This membrane is like a thin skin that holds the cell together and controls what goes in and out. Inside the cell is a jelly-like substance called cytoplasm. Floating in the cytoplasm are special parts called organelles.\n\nThe most important organelle is the nucleus. The nucleus is like the brain of the cell. It contains DNA, which is like an instruction book that tells the cell what to do. Another important organelle is the mitochondria. Mitochondria are like tiny batteries that give the cell energy.\n\nPlant cells have some extra parts that animal cells do not have. Plant cells have a hard cell wall outside the cell membrane. This wall helps plants stand up straight. Plant cells also have chloroplasts, which are green parts that use sunlight to make food for the plant. This is why plants are green!\n\nSome organisms have just one cell. These are called unicellular organisms. Bacteria are unicellular. One single cell does everything the organism needs to survive. Other organisms, like you, have billions of cells working together. These are called multicellular organisms. In your body, different types of cells do different jobs. Muscle cells help you move. Nerve cells help you think. Blood cells carry oxygen around your body."

Sarah carefully peels a thin piece of skin from an onion. She places it on a glass slide and adds a drop of iodine to stain the cells. Then she puts the slide under the microscope.\n\nAt first, Sarah cannot see anything clearly. Her teacher helps her adjust the focus knob. Suddenly, she can see rows and rows of rectangular shapes. These are the onion cells! Sarah can see the cell wall around each cell. She can also see the darker nucleus inside each cell.\n\nNext, Sarah looks at her own cheek cells. She gently scrapes the inside of her cheek with a cotton swab and puts the cells on a new slide. These cells look different from the onion cells. They are rounder and do not have cell walls.",

          "conceptExplanation": "Cell theory is one of the most important ideas in biology. It was developed in the 1800s when scientists used microscopes to observe that all living things are made of cells. The theory has three main points: all living organisms are composed of cells, the cell is the basic unit of structure and function in living things, and new cells are produced from existing cells.\n\nWhen you look inside a cell, you find many different structures called organelles, each with its own job. The nucleus is the largest organelle and acts as the cell's control centre. It contains DNA, which holds the instructions for everything the cell does. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope.\n\nMitochondria are often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell. They carry out cellular respiration, a process that breaks down glucose (sugar) to release energy. This energy is used for all the cell's activities. Active cells, like muscle cells, have many mitochondria because they need lots of energy.\n\nPlant cells have some organelles that animal cells do not have. Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll and carry out photosynthesis, converting sunlight into food (glucose). This is why plants are green. Plant cells also have a rigid cell wall outside their cell membrane, which gives plants their structure. The large central vacuole in plant cells stores water and helps maintain cell pressure.\n\nSome organisms, like bacteria and some protists, are unicellular, meaning their entire body is just one cell. This single cell must carry out all the functions needed for life. Multicellular organisms, like humans, are made of trillions of cells that work together. In multicellular organisms, cells become specialised for different jobs. For example, red blood cells carry oxygen, nerve cells transmit signals, and muscle cells enable movement."

          "scenario": "Year 8 student Marcus is completing a practical investigation comparing plant and animal cells. First, he prepares a wet mount slide of onion epidermis (the thin skin layer). He carefully peels a small piece of transparent onion skin and places it flat on a glass slide. He adds a drop of iodine stain to make the cell structures more visible, then gently lowers a cover slip to avoid air bubbles.\n\nUnder the microscope at 400x magnification, Marcus can clearly see the rectangular onion cells arranged in neat rows. The cell walls appear as dark lines between cells, and he can see the nucleus as a darker oval shape within each cell. He notices the large central vacuole takes up most of the cell space.\n\nNext, Marcus prepares a slide of his own cheek cells. He gently scrapes the inside of his cheek with a clean cotton swab and spreads the cells on a slide. Using methylene blue stain, he can now see the cells clearly. These cells are very different: they are irregular in shape, much smaller, and do not have the rigid rectangular structure of the plant cells.",

          "conceptExplanation": "Cell theory represents one of the unifying principles of biology. Its development began in 1665 when Robert Hooke observed cork under a microscope and coined the term 'cell' because the compartments resembled monks' cells in a monastery. Anton van Leeuwenhoek later observed living cells, including bacteria and protists. In 1838-1839, Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann proposed that all plants and animals are made of cells. Rudolf Virchow completed the theory in 1855 with his famous statement 'Omnis cellula e cellula' (all cells come from cells).\n\nInside eukaryotic cells (cells with a nucleus), organelles carry out specialised functions. The nucleus, enclosed by a double nuclear membrane with pores, contains chromosomes made of DNA. This genetic material carries the instructions for making proteins and controlling cell activities. When a protein is needed, the relevant gene is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which travels to the ribosomes for translation.\n\nMitochondria are essential for energy production. These organelles have their own DNA and double membrane, with the inner membrane folded into cristae to increase surface area. During cellular respiration, glucose is broken down through a series of reactions: glycolysis in the cytoplasm, followed by the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain in the mitochondria. This process produces ATP, the energy currency of cells.\n\nPlant cells possess additional structures. The cell wall, composed of cellulose fibres, provides structural support and prevents the cell from bursting when water enters. Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, have their own DNA and double membrane. They contain chlorophyll, which captures light energy for photosynthesis. The large central vacuole stores water, nutrients, and waste products, and maintains turgor pressure to keep the plant upright.\n\nUnicellular organisms like bacteria differ significantly from eukaryotic cells. Bacteria are prokaryotes, meaning they lack a membrane-bound nucleus. Their DNA exists as a single circular chromosome in the cytoplasm. While bacteria have ribosomes, they lack membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria. Many bacteria have a cell wall (made of peptidoglycan) and some have additional structures like flagella for movement or pili for attachment.\n\nThe study of cells has been revolutionised by advances in microscopy. Light microscopes can magnify up to about 1000x and have a resolution of approximately 200 nanometres, allowing observation of cells and large organelles. Electron microscopes use electron beams instead of light and can achieve magnifications over 100,000x with resolution down to 0.2 nanometres. Transmission electron microscopes (TEM) pass electrons through thin specimens to show internal structure, while scanning electron microscopes (SEM) bounce electrons off surfaces to show 3D detail. These technologies have enabled discoveries like the structure of ribosomes and the detailed organisation of the cytoskeleton."

Today, she is training her new research assistant, James, to identify different cell types using light microscopy.\n\nFirst, they examine prepared slides of human blood cells. Under the microscope, James can see red blood cells as small, circular, biconcave discs without nuclei. Sarah explains that mature human red blood cells lose their nucleus to maximise space for haemoglobin. They also observe white blood cells, which are larger and have visible nuclei.\n\nNext, they look at plant leaf tissue. The mesophyll cells are clearly visible with their green chloroplasts distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The cells have a regular rectangular shape due to their cell walls, and the large central vacuole pushes the cytoplasm and organelles to the edges of each cell.\n\nFinally, Sarah shows James a slide of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. These cells are much smaller than the plant and animal cells, appearing as tiny rod shapes. Even at high magnification, individual organelles are not visible because bacteria are prokaryotes without membrane-bound organelles. Sarah explains that to see detailed bacterial structure, they would need to use an electron microscope.",

            }
          ],
          "conceptExplanation": "The development of cell theory represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of life. Robert Hooke's 1665 observation of cork cells provided the first glimpse of cellular structure, but it was Anton van Leeuwenhoek's superior lenses that revealed living cells, including bacteria, protozoa, and blood cells. The generalisation that all organisms are composed of cells came from the botanical studies of Matthias Schleiden (1838) and the zoological work of Theodor Schwann (1839). Rudolf Virchow's 1855 declaration 'Omnis cellula e cellula' (all cells arise from cells) completed the classical formulation, overturning the earlier belief in spontaneous generation.\n\nAt the ultrastructural level, organelle architecture is precisely tailored to function. The mitochondrion's double membrane creates distinct compartments essential for oxidative phosphorylation. The outer membrane is permeable to small molecules, while the inner membrane, folded into cristae, is impermeable except through specific transport proteins. This impermeability is crucial for maintaining the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. The electron transport chain complexes (I, II, III, and IV) are embedded in the inner membrane, pumping protons into the intermembrane space, while ATP synthase harnesses the gradient to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. Cells with high energy demands, such as cardiac muscle cells, contain thousands of mitochondria with densely packed cristae.\n\nChloroplasts exhibit equally sophisticated organisation. The thylakoid membranes contain photosystem I and II, organised to maximise light capture and energy transfer. Grana (stacks of thylakoids) increase the concentration of photosynthetic machinery, while the stroma contains enzymes for the Calvin cycle. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use chemiosmosis to produce ATP, though they also use the light reactions to generate NADPH for carbon fixation.\n\nThe endosymbiotic theory, championed by Lynn Margulis, explains why mitochondria and chloroplasts share features with bacteria. Their double membranes reflect their origin—the inner membrane from the original prokaryote, the outer from the host cell's engulfment vesicle. Their circular DNA, prokaryotic-type ribosomes (70S rather than 80S), and reproduction by binary fission all support bacterial ancestry. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that mitochondria are related to alpha-proteobacteria, while chloroplasts are related to cyanobacteria.\n\nMicroscopy technology has been crucial to these discoveries. Light microscopy, limited by the diffraction of light to approximately 200 nm resolution, can visualise cells and large organelles but not molecular detail. Electron microscopy overcame this limitation, with transmission EM revealing ultrastructure and scanning EM providing surface topology. Recent advances have been transformative: confocal microscopy creates optical sections for 3D reconstruction; cryo-EM preserves samples in vitreous ice, allowing near-atomic resolution of protein complexes; and super-resolution techniques like PALM and STORM bypass the diffraction limit to achieve resolutions below 50 nm. The 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognised these super-resolution developments.\n\nProkaryotic cells, while simpler in organisation, are remarkably diverse and successful. Lacking membrane-bound organelles, they carry out metabolic processes across their plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Bacterial cell walls composed of peptidoglycan distinguish them from archaea (which have different wall compositions) and from eukaryotes. Some bacteria possess additional structures including capsules for protection, flagella for motility, and pili for attachment or DNA transfer. Despite their apparent simplicity, prokaryotes occupy virtually every habitat on Earth and play essential roles in biogeochemical cycles."

Her team is investigating how mitochondria respond to cellular stress using cutting-edge imaging techniques.\n\nUsing confocal fluorescence microscopy, they tag mitochondria with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to observe mitochondrial dynamics in living cells. In healthy cells, they observe mitochondria constantly fusing and dividing, creating a dynamic network. However, when they induce oxidative stress, the mitochondrial network fragments into small, isolated organelles.\n\nTo understand why this happens, the team turns to cryo-electron microscopy. By flash-freezing stressed cells and imaging them at near-atomic resolution, they can visualise changes in the cristae structure. In stressed cells, the cristae become disorganised, reducing the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. They identify specific changes in the ATP synthase complexes that correlate with reduced energy production.\n\nTheir research has implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, where mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to contribute to cell death. By understanding how stress affects mitochondrial structure and function, the team hopes to identify potential therapeutic targets.",

          "conceptExplanation": "Cell theory emerged from a synthesis of 17th-19th century observations, yet its apparent simplicity masks considerable sophistication. The proposition that 'all living things are composed of cells' immediately raises the question: what constitutes life? Viruses, with their protein coats and nucleic acid genomes, parasitise cellular machinery but lack independent metabolism. Are they alive? Similarly, Virchow's dictum that 'all cells arise from pre-existing cells' must be reconciled with the origin of the first cells—a challenge that directs us toward prebiotic chemistry and the RNA world hypothesis. Contemporary cell theory is better understood as a framework requiring nuanced interpretation rather than absolute law.\n\nThe molecular organisation of organelles represents exquisite evolutionary optimisation. Consider the mitochondrial inner membrane: its cristae are not simply infoldings but specialised domains connected to the inner boundary membrane by cristae junctions—narrow tubular structures that may regulate metabolite and protein exchange. The ATP synthase complexes concentrate at the edges of cristae, where the membrane curvature is greatest, and this arrangement maximises the efficiency of the proton-motive force utilisation. Recent cryo-electron tomography studies have revealed that the electron transport complexes are not randomly distributed but form supercomplexes (respirasomes), reducing the diffusion distances for electron carriers and increasing metabolic efficiency.\n\nChloroplasts exhibit equally sophisticated organisation. The grana stacks contain primarily Photosystem II and its associated antenna complexes, while the stroma lamellae are enriched in Photosystem I and ATP synthase. This spatial separation helps balance the electron flow between the two photosystems and may facilitate cyclic electron flow around PSI for additional ATP production. The structural basis for this organisation involves specific lipid compositions and protein-protein interactions that remain active areas of research.\n\nThe endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts is now supported by substantial evidence, though significant questions remain regarding eukaryogenesis more broadly. Phylogenomic analyses consistently place mitochondria within the alpha-proteobacteria, closely related to Rickettsiales (obligate intracellular parasites/symbionts). Chloroplasts derive from cyanobacteria, with primary endosymbiosis occurring once, followed by secondary and tertiary endosymbioses in some lineages. The nature of the host cell remains contentious: the hydrogen hypothesis proposes an archaeal host, while alternative models propose different scenarios. Recent discoveries of archaea with eukaryotic-like features (such as Lokiarchaeota) support a close relationship between archaea and the host lineage.\n\nMicroscopy technology has transformed from a limiting factor to a driving force in cell biology. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognised cryo-electron microscopy, which can now achieve near-atomic resolution for protein complexes. Super-resolution fluorescence techniques including STED, PALM, and STORM have broken the diffraction barrier, enabling localisation of single molecules with precision below 20 nm. Correlative approaches (CLEM) combine the molecular specificity of fluorescence with the ultrastructural context of electron microscopy. Lattice light-sheet microscopy enables gentle, high-speed imaging of living cells in three dimensions. These technologies are not merely incremental improvements but represent qualitative advances that enable entirely new questions to be asked about cellular organisation and dynamics.\n\nThe ongoing integration of structural biology, genomics, biochemistry, and advanced imaging is revealing cells as highly organised entities where spatial arrangements are as important as molecular identities. Understanding the cell increasingly requires considering it as a complex system where emergent properties arise from the interactions of components at multiple scales."

Their work has revealed unprecedented detail about how the molecular machinery of oxidative phosphorylation is arranged within the organelle.\n\nUsing cryo-ET, they demonstrated that ATP synthase dimers arrange themselves in rows along the edges of cristae, and that this arrangement is essential for cristae morphology—the curved edges of cristae are actually shaped by the ATP synthase dimers themselves. When ATP synthase is disrupted, cristae lose their characteristic morphology, demonstrating a structural as well as enzymatic role for this complex.\n\nFurther studies revealed the organisation of the electron transport chain complexes. Respiratory supercomplexes containing Complex I, III, and IV were visualised in situ for the first time, providing direct evidence for functional associations previously inferred from biochemical studies. The spatial arrangement of these supercomplexes with respect to cristae topology suggested a role in directing proton flux to ATP synthase.\n\nThis research exemplifies how modern imaging technology can move beyond static structural biology to reveal dynamic, functional organisation. It also demonstrates the power of studying structures in their native cellular context rather than in isolation, providing insights that purified preparations cannot offer.",

ATP synthase dimers localise at the curved edges of cristae, where the high local proton concentration maximises the proton-motive force driving ATP synthesis. The narrow cristae junctions restrict diffusion of protons out of the intracristal space, maintaining the gradient.

These organisms possess genes previously thought unique to eukaryotes, including genes for actin-like cytoskeletal proteins, proteins involved in membrane remodelling, and ubiquitin-like systems. This supports models where the host cell in the primary endosymbiotic event was an archaeon with some eukaryotic-like features, rather than a lineage that acquired these features after the endosymbiosis.\n\nHowever, several questions remain. Lokiarchaeota have not been visualised or cultured, so their actual cellular organisation is unknown. Whether they possess internal membranes or any compartmentalisation—features that might have facilitated engulfment of the mitochondrial ancestor—remains speculative. The metabolic nature of the host and how it interacted with the alpha-proteobacterial ancestor (e.g., was it based on hydrogen syntrophy as proposed by the hydrogen hypothesis?) is debated.\n\nFuture research could address these questions through: environmental genomics to identify and characterise more Asgard archaea; attempts to culture these organisms or study them in enrichment cultures; cryo-ET of environmental samples to potentially visualise their cell structure; comparative genomics to reconstruct the gene content of the last eukaryotic common ancestor; and development of better models for the metabolic basis of the initial host-symbiont interaction. Ultimately, understanding eukaryogenesis requires integrating evidence from genomics, cell biology, and biochemistry.",
