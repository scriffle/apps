Variables: Independent - caffeine consumption (with/without); Dependent - reaction time in milliseconds; Controlled - same participants, same test, same time of day, same testing environment, no other stimulants consumed. Equipment: Online reaction time test, stopwatch backup, caffeine tablets (100mg standardised dose), data recording sheets, consent forms. Method: (1) Recruit 20 volunteer participants aged 15-16, (2) Obtain informed consent, (3) On day 1, test all participants' reaction time using online test - 5 attempts each, record average, (4) Randomly assign participants to caffeine or placebo group, (5) On day 2, same time, caffeine group receives 100mg caffeine, placebo group receives identical-looking placebo, (6) Wait 30 minutes for absorption, (7) Test reaction time again - 5 attempts, record average, (8) Calculate change in reaction time for each participant. Reliability strategies: Using 20 participants reduces individual variation, 5 reaction tests averaged per person reduces measurement error, standardised caffeine dose and timing ensures consistency. Validity strategies: Placebo control group eliminates expectation effects, same test used throughout eliminates test variation, controlling time of day eliminates tiredness variation.

Replication (repeating trials) allows identification of anomalies and calculation of averages, making results more reliable.

Research question: Does a single 200mg dose of caffeine affect visual reaction time in 16-18 year old students compared to placebo, as measured using a standardised computer-based reaction test? Operationalised variables: IV - caffeine condition (200mg caffeine tablet vs. identical placebo); DV - mean reaction time in milliseconds across 20 trials on a visual stimulus reaction test; CVs - time of day, prior sleep, prior caffeine abstention (12 hours), testing environment, practice effects (warm-up trials). Controls: Negative control (placebo group establishes baseline); double-blind design (neither participant nor tester knows who received caffeine, controlling for expectation effects). Potential confounds and solutions: Prior caffeine use/tolerance - require 12-hour caffeine abstention and assess regular caffeine intake; individual variation in metabolism - use within-subjects design where each participant tests both conditions on different days; time of day effects - test all participants at the same time; learning effects - counterbalance order (half caffeine-first, half placebo-first) and use practice trials. Ethical considerations: Informed consent, right to withdraw, no participants with caffeine sensitivity or medical contraindications, appropriate dose (less than a strong coffee), ethics approval. Sample size: Minimum 30 participants based on power analysis for detecting medium effect size; within-subjects design increases power. Equipment: Computer-based reaction test (precision 1ms), standardised caffeine tablets, identical placebo tablets, stopwatch for timing post-dose wait (30 minutes for absorption), standardised data recording sheets.

Power is the probability of correctly detecting a genuine effect (avoiding Type II error). Effect size measures the magnitude of the phenomenon - larger effects are easier to detect. Sample size provides the amount of data available to distinguish effects from noise. These factors interact: for a given power level, detecting smaller effects requires larger samples, while larger effects can be detected with smaller samples. For example, to achieve 80% power to detect a large effect might require 30 participants per group, while the same power to detect a small effect might require 300 per group. When planning research, investigators should conduct a power analysis to determine the minimum sample size needed. This requires estimating the expected effect size (based on theory or previous research) and selecting desired power (typically 80-90%). This ensures the study is large enough to detect effects if they exist, avoiding wasted resources on underpowered studies that can only detect unrealistically large effects.
