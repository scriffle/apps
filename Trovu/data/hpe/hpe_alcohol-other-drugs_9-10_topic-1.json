If someone expects a drug to make them relaxed, they're more likely to feel relaxed. This works both ways - expecting a bad experience can contribute to anxiety or a bad trip. Expectations are influenced by what they've heard, past experiences, and the environment. This is why drug effects can vary so much between people even with the same drug.

Over time, normal activities that used to be enjoyable produce less pleasure because the dopamine system has adapted to the drug's effects. People then need the drug just to feel normal, not just to feel good. This drives continued use and increases doses, leading to addiction. The brain has essentially been rewired to prioritise the drug over natural rewards."

When young people encounter exaggerated claims and then see friends using drugs without immediate extreme consequences, they lose trust in all drug information, including accurate warnings. Scare tactics don't address why people use drugs or provide skills to navigate real situations. They may increase curiosity rather than deter use. Effective education provides accurate, balanced information; develops decision-making and refusal skills; addresses underlying reasons for use; and is age-appropriate and relevant. However, some argue that highlighting real consequences has value if done accurately. The key is honesty - acknowledging that some drug use doesn't cause immediate harm while explaining genuine long-term risks builds credibility and allows informed decisions."

Injecting and smoking deliver drugs very quickly (seconds to minutes), producing intense effects but also higher risk of overdose and addiction. Swallowing is slower (30-60 minutes) because the drug must pass through the digestive system, which also breaks down some of the drug. Faster routes tend to be more addictive because the brain makes stronger associations between the drug and pleasure."

          "sampleAnswer": "When the stomach is empty, alcohol passes quickly into the small intestine where it's absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream. Food slows gastric emptying, keeping alcohol in the stomach longer where absorption is slower. Food also dilutes the alcohol concentration. The result is that the same amount of alcohol on an empty stomach produces a faster rise in blood alcohol concentration and more intense effects. This is why eating before drinking is recommended to slow absorption."

Evidence shows that harm reduction services (like needle exchanges and supervised injecting facilities) do not increase drug use but do reduce harms like overdose deaths and disease transmission. They also engage people with health services who otherwise might not access care. Critics argue it sends a mixed message, but research doesn't support this - people who use drugs understand that health services aren't endorsing drug use. Harm reduction acknowledges reality: some people will use drugs regardless of prohibition, and keeping them alive creates opportunities for recovery. It's a pragmatic, evidence-based approach rather than 'enabling.'"

How severe is withdrawal? 3) Chronic health harms - long-term physical effects on organs and systems. 4) Mental health impacts - risk of mental health conditions or worsening existing ones. 5) Social harms - effects on relationships, employment, finances. 6) Intoxication harms - accidents, violence, risk-taking while impaired. 7) Method-specific harms - risks from how the drug is taken (injection, smoking).

When purity unexpectedly increases, the same volume contains more active drug than expected, leading to overdose. This is why drug-checking services are a harm reduction tool - knowing actual content allows more informed dosing. Purity variation is a key reason illegal drug use is riskier than it might otherwise be, and why periods of new supply or drought can see overdose spikes."

          "sampleAnswer": "This requires nuanced analysis. Evidence suggests prohibition hasn't eliminated drug use and creates harms: criminal records affecting lives, dangerous unregulated supply, barriers to help-seeking, massive incarceration costs, and empowerment of criminal organisations. Some harms of drug use are actually harms of prohibition. However, 'legalise everything' is simplistic. Drugs have different risk profiles; regulations could vary accordingly. Decriminalisation (removing criminal penalties for personal use while keeping sales illegal) differs from full legalisation with regulated supply. Portugal's decriminalisation hasn't increased use and has reduced HIV and overdose deaths. Cannabis legalisation in various jurisdictions provides data showing no disaster scenarios but some concerns (commercialisation, marketing to youth). Full legalisation of high-harm drugs like methamphetamine raises different concerns. A nuanced position recognises drug policy reform is needed, prohibition has failed, but thoughtful regulation (not simply 'legalise everything') is required, with different approaches for different drugs."

It centred particular communities (often regional, lower-income) while downplaying similar stimulant use in professional contexts. It emphasised individual responsibility and moral failure rather than social factors. Sensationalism increased public fear but didn't necessarily improve understanding of evidence-based responses.

          "sampleAnswer": "The brain disease model helpfully recognises neurobiological changes, reducing moral blame and stigma. It's scientifically accurate that addiction involves measurable brain changes. However, it can be reductive - implying a broken brain needing medical fix, underplaying that most people who use drugs don't become addicted, that recovery happens through many paths not just medical treatment, and that social factors strongly influence both addiction and recovery. The choice/environment framing captures agency and context but risks blaming individuals and ignoring neurobiology. Integrated understanding recognises: initial use involves some choice within constraints; repeated use changes the brain reducing subsequent choice capacity; environment and social factors strongly influence both vulnerability and recovery; and multiple pathways to recovery exist. This avoids both overclaiming medical model and overstating individual responsibility."

This acknowledges drugs have different risk profiles requiring different responses, that criminalising users creates harm, but that unregulated commercial markets also create problems."

Anticipated stigma (expecting negative responses) makes people reluctant to disclose to healthcare providers, employers, or family. Structural stigma (discriminatory policies, underfunded services) reduces access to care. Experienced stigma (judgmental treatment from healthcare providers) discourages future help-seeking. The result is that people delay seeking help until problems are severe, reducing treatment effectiveness. Reducing stigma through language change, education, and integrating addiction treatment into mainstream healthcare is essential for improving help-seeking and outcomes."

Change may require: shifting public opinion, building coalitions, framing reform in acceptable terms, incremental approaches that demonstrate safety, and centring evidence while acknowledging values."

The paternalist position argues that some interference is justified to protect people from themselves, especially when addiction undermines the very autonomy being defended, or when people can't adequately assess risks. The tension is about where to draw the line: should government prevent people from harming themselves, or only from harming others? Drug policy sits at this intersection because drug use primarily harms the user but has secondary effects on others."

          "sampleAnswer": "Labelling theory suggests that when someone is officially labelled as deviant (e.g., 'criminal,' 'drug addict'), this label becomes part of their identity. They may be treated differently by others (stigma), lose access to conventional opportunities (employment, housing), and come to see themselves through the label. Once labelled a criminal or addict, conventional pathways become harder, and deviant identity and networks may become more appealing. The criminal justice response - arrest, court, potentially prison - reinforces deviant identity and connections with other labelled people. The prediction is that criminalisation strengthens rather than weakens drug involvement for those caught in the system, and evidence on recidivism and outcomes supports this."

Whose preferences count when there's conflict? What level of risk is acceptable? What's the appropriate role of government? Evidence can show what outcomes different policies produce, but choosing between outcomes requires values. Evidence is also contested - different stakeholders emphasise different studies, interpret findings differently, and disagree about what outcomes matter. Additionally, policy happens in political context where interests, ideology, and electoral considerations matter. Evidence must compete with moral intuitions, media framing, and institutional interests. Finally, much drug policy was set before current evidence existed and has path-dependency momentum. Evidence is necessary but not sufficient for policy - it must be combined with explicit value deliberation."

          "sampleAnswer": "This claim has substantial support: historical analysis shows drug laws have targeted specific groups - opium laws targeting Chinese immigrants, marijuana laws connected to Mexican and Black communities, crack cocaine disparities reflecting racial politics. Enforcement has always been racially and class-disparate. The most harmful drugs (alcohol, tobacco) remain legal when they're used by dominant groups. However, the claim may be overstated - there are genuine health concerns about drug harms, and some regulations protect public health. Public health rationale has grown over time even if origins were discriminatory. The most defensible position recognises both: drug laws have served social control functions, AND some drug regulations protect health. Acknowledging discriminatory history and current disparities is essential for legitimate policy, but dismissing all concern about drug harm oversimplifies. Reform should address both discriminatory enforcement AND genuine health protection."

          "question": "Develop a framework for thinking about when drug policy paternalism is justified.",
          "sampleAnswer": "Framework for justified paternalism: 1) Graduated by decisional capacity - stronger paternalism for children and those with impaired capacity; adults presumed competent. 2) Proportionality - intervention should be proportionate to harm severity; more intervention for severe, irreversible harms. 3) Less restrictive alternative - use least restrictive means that achieves health goal (information before regulation before prohibition). 4) Procedural requirements - decisions should be democratic, evidence-informed, and include affected voices. 5) Reversibility test - harder to justify restricting liberty when restriction's own harms are irreversible (criminal records, incarceration). 6) Equity consideration - if policy harms marginalised groups more, additional justification required. 7) Self-regarding vs other-regarding - stronger justification for preventing harm to others; weaker for pure self-harm. 8) Coercion gradient - distinguish information provision, incentives, regulations, and prohibition. Application: current prohibition of cannabis for personal adult use probably fails this test; regulation of sales to children doesn't; views on harder drugs are more contested."

This creates constraints on national reform - technically, full legalisation violates treaty obligations. Countries have found workarounds: decriminalisation (not technically legalisation), medical access (permitted under conventions), reinterpreting treaty flexibility, or simply violating treaties (cannabis legalisation in Canada, Uruguay, US states). There's tension between national sovereignty and international commitments. The conventions were designed for prohibition and make reform difficult. Recent UN discourse allows more flexibility, but fundamental reform requires either treaty amendment, withdrawal, or critical mass of countries acting independently."

          "question": "Critically synthesise arguments about whether addiction undermines the autonomy that justifies drug legalisation, or whether this becomes circular reasoning for prohibition.",
          "sampleAnswer": "The autonomy-undermining argument: Addiction neurobiologically impairs decision-making capacity. If autonomy justifies allowing drug use, but drug use undermines autonomy, the justification self-defeats. Paternalism to prevent addiction protects future autonomy. The circularity critique: This reasoning can justify any prohibition (alcohol addiction also undermines autonomy). It presumes most use leads to addiction (untrue). It uses outcomes to restrict initial choices. It disempowers people who use drugs by declaring them non-autonomous. Prohibition creates its own autonomy violations (incarceration, criminal records). Synthesis: The argument has some force for highly addictive drugs but becomes circular if used to justify all prohibition. Possible resolutions: distinguish first-time users (autonomous) from dependent users (impaired); use probability-weighted justification (stronger paternalism for drugs with higher addiction risk); focus on protecting capacity to exit rather than preventing entry; recognise that both addiction AND criminalisation undermine autonomy - choose lesser evil. Most sophisticated position: regulate to maintain autonomy (information, quality control, exit support) rather than prohibit to prevent all risk. Acknowledge contested values and avoid either extreme position."
