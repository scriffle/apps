When you are not looking after your body, your mood can suffer. That is why looking after both your mind and body is important.\n\nThe media, especially social media, can have a big effect on how young people feel about themselves. Studies show that many young people feel worse about their bodies after looking at social media. This is because they compare themselves to images that have been changed to look perfect. No one really looks like that.\n\nDifferent cultures have different ideas about what bodies should look like. Some cultures value larger bodies, while others value thinner ones. Some value muscles, others do not. Learning that beauty standards are different around the world can help you see that there is no one right way to look.\n\nYou have the power to help others think about health in positive ways. When you talk to your friends about mental health or body image, you can help them feel better. When you support health campaigns or create your own health messages, you are making a difference. Young people often listen more to other young people than to adults, so your voice matters."

Her friends often say mean things about their own bodies after looking at these accounts. Lily learned in class that most of these photos are edited.\n\nLily decided to do something about it. For a school project, she created a poster that showed a photo before and after editing. The poster said 'What you see is not always real' and explained how photos are changed. She also included tips for feeling good about your body.\n\nHer teacher liked the poster so much that she asked if it could be displayed in the school hallway. Other students started talking about it. Some said they had not realised how much photos were changed. Lily's friend Mei said the poster made her feel better about herself.\n\nLily felt proud that her small action had made a difference.

When you are anxious, your heart might race and your muscles might tense. When you are physically unwell, you might feel down or irritable. Looking after both aspects of health creates a positive cycle.\n\nBody image develops from many influences. Family comments, peer opinions, media images, and cultural messages all shape how you see your body. The problem with media is that it often shows only one type of body as ideal, and even those images are usually edited. This creates an impossible standard that no one can actually meet.\n\nDifferent cultures have very different ideas about ideal bodies. In some Pacific Island cultures, larger bodies are valued as signs of health and prosperity. In some Asian cultures, there are specific beauty standards related to skin tone and facial features. Aboriginal cultures value connection to Country and community over appearance. Understanding these differences helps us see that beauty standards are created by society, not fixed by nature.\n\nYou have more power to influence health than you might think. Research shows that peer-led health promotion can be very effective because young people are more likely to trust and listen to other young people. By talking openly about mental health, challenging unrealistic beauty standards, and sharing accurate health information, you can make a real difference in your community."

It started in 2009 after the founder's father died by suicide, and now millions of Australians participate each year.\n\nAt Riverside Secondary College, the student wellbeing committee decided to run R U OK? Day activities. They planned conversation stations where students could practise asking 'Are you okay?' and listening to answers. They created posters with messages like 'A conversation could change a life' and shared facts about mental health.\n\nStudent leader Marcus was initially nervous about talking about mental health. He worried people would think it was awkward or uncool. But he decided to be brave and share his own experience of feeling stressed during Year 7 and how talking to a friend had helped.\n\nThe response surprised him. Many students approached him afterwards to say they related to his story. Teachers reported that students seemed more willing to talk about their feelings. The school counsellor noticed an increase in students seeking support, which was seen as a positive sign that barriers to help-seeking were being reduced.\n\nMarcus reflected: 'I used to think mental health was something you kept private. Now I realise that talking about it is actually one of the best things you can do, both for yourself and for others.'",

          "conceptExplanation": "Mental health and physical health are increasingly recognised as inseparable. The World Health Organization defines health as 'a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease.' This holistic view acknowledges that you cannot be truly healthy if your mental health is suffering, regardless of your physical condition.\n\nThe relationship between media and body image has been extensively researched. Studies consistently show that exposure to thin-ideal media increases body dissatisfaction in women, and exposure to muscular-ideal media has similar effects in men. Social media appears to have particularly strong effects because of its personalised, constant, and interactive nature. Unlike traditional media, social media allows endless comparison with peers, not just celebrities.\n\nHowever, media can also be a force for positive change. Body-positive movements use social media to challenge narrow beauty standards and celebrate body diversity. Mental health campaigns like R U OK?, Beyond Blue, and Headspace use media to reduce stigma and encourage help-seeking. Young people can harness the same platforms that sometimes cause harm to instead promote wellbeing.\n\nCultural competence is essential in discussing bodies and mental health. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have holistic understandings of health that include spiritual, cultural, and community dimensions alongside physical and mental health. Asian cultures may have different attitudes toward discussing mental health, shaped by cultural values around family, harmony, and emotional expression. Effective health promotion respects and incorporates these diverse perspectives rather than imposing a single cultural framework.\n\nYour generation has both unique challenges and unique opportunities regarding mental health and body image. You face more media exposure and comparison opportunities than any previous generation. But you also have more access to information, support resources, and platforms for promoting positive change. By understanding the issues and taking action, you can help create healthier communities."

They surveyed 150 students in Years 7-9, asking about social media use, body satisfaction, and knowledge of photo editing.\n\nThe results were concerning: 78% of students reported comparing their appearance to people they saw online, and 62% said this comparison usually made them feel worse about themselves. However, only 35% were confident they could tell when a photo had been digitally altered.\n\nThe students decided to create a multi-part intervention. First, they developed a presentation teaching peers how to spot edited photos, including before-and-after examples and information about common editing techniques. Second, they created a social media page sharing unedited photos of real students (with permission) alongside messages about body diversity. Third, they organised a 'Social Media Break Challenge' encouraging students to take a day off from image-focused apps.\n\nThe school counsellor, Ms Patel, supported the project and noticed positive effects. 'What made this work was that it came from the students themselves,' she said. 'They understood the issue from the inside and knew how to reach their peers. Some students told me they felt relieved to know others felt the same way.'\n\nSix weeks later, a follow-up survey showed improved ability to identify edited photos (up to 67%) and a slight reduction in negative comparison behaviours.",

As media from Western countries spreads through global platforms, communities that once valued diverse body types may increasingly adopt narrow Western ideals. This could lead to rising body dissatisfaction in populations previously protected by local beauty norms, potential increases in eating disorders and mental health issues, erosion of cultural diversity in concepts of beauty, and commercial exploitation as diet and beauty industries expand into new markets.\n\nThe implications are particularly concerning for Indigenous communities, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, whose holistic concepts of health and identity may be displaced by appearance-focused Western values. The loss of cultural protective factors could compound existing health disparities.\n\nHealth promotion could respond in several ways: supporting local media that celebrates diverse bodies, working with communities to articulate and strengthen their own beauty traditions, developing media literacy programs adapted to different cultural contexts, advocating for regulation of harmful advertising in emerging markets, amplifying diverse voices in global media, and researching body image in non-Western contexts to inform culturally appropriate interventions.\n\nHowever, responses must avoid cultural paternalism—the assumption that traditional values are always better. Young people in all cultures negotiate multiple influences and make their own meanings. Effective health promotion would support critical thinking and agency rather than simply promoting alternative beauty standards.\n\nUltimately, the goal should be a world where body diversity is celebrated across all cultures, and no single standard of beauty dominates global consciousness.",

          "conceptExplanation": "The biopsychosocial model represents a paradigm shift in understanding mental health. Earlier models either attributed mental illness to biological abnormalities (the biomedical model) or to environmental factors (psychosocial models). The biopsychosocial model integrates these perspectives, recognising that biology, psychology, and social context continuously interact. A genetic predisposition might increase vulnerability, but whether this vulnerability leads to a mental health condition depends on psychological factors (coping skills, cognitive patterns) and social factors (support systems, life stressors). This model implies that intervention can occur at any level—medication can address biological factors, therapy can address psychological factors, and social support can address social factors.\n\nAdolescent brain development provides biological context for understanding mental health vulnerability during this period. Neuroimaging research shows that the limbic system, responsible for emotional responses and reward processing, matures earlier than the prefrontal cortex, responsible for rational decision-making and impulse control. This developmental asymmetry helps explain adolescents' heightened emotional reactivity, sensitivity to peer evaluation, and risk-taking tendencies. It also creates windows of both vulnerability and opportunity—negative experiences during this period can have lasting impacts, but positive interventions may be particularly effective.\n\nThe media-body image relationship has been extensively researched. Meta-analyses (studies combining results from multiple studies) confirm that exposure to thin-ideal media causes body dissatisfaction in experimental settings. The effect is stronger for women but is also present in men exposed to muscular-ideal media. Social comparison theory explains this effect: people evaluate themselves by comparing to others, and when comparison targets are unrealistically attractive, self-evaluation suffers. The tripartite influence model identifies media, parents, and peers as the three main sources of appearance-related pressures.\n\nIntersectionality, a concept originating in feminist legal scholarship, has become increasingly influential in health research. An intersectional lens reveals that experiences of body image and mental health are shaped by multiple, interacting aspects of identity. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people may face unique pressures from the intersection of Western beauty standards and the ongoing impacts of colonisation. Young people from Asian backgrounds may navigate different cultural expectations around appearance and emotional expression. LGBTQ+ young people may face body image pressures specific to their communities. Effective health promotion must attend to these intersections rather than assuming a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nHealth promotion has evolved from simple information provision to sophisticated, multi-level interventions. The Ottawa Charter (1986) established that health promotion requires action across multiple domains, from individual skill-building to policy change. Contemporary health promotion is participatory, involving communities in identifying needs and designing solutions. Youth participation is not just ethically appropriate but strategically effective—young people bring insights, credibility, and networks that adult-designed programs often lack."

The program was created in response to concerns about high rates of psychological distress among Aboriginal youth and the perceived inadequacy of mainstream mental health approaches.\n\nThe development process began with extensive consultation with Aboriginal young people, Elders, and community members. Participants identified that mainstream mental health messages did not resonate with Aboriginal understandings of health, which encompass connection to Country, culture, family, and community. The term 'social and emotional wellbeing' was preferred over 'mental health' as it better captured the holistic Aboriginal concept of health.\n\nThe resulting program incorporated culturally meaningful elements: connection to Country through on-Country activities, cultural activities like art and storytelling, Elders sharing traditional knowledge about wellbeing, peer support from trained Aboriginal youth leaders, and content addressing the specific challenges faced by Aboriginal young people, including racism and intergenerational trauma.\n\nEvaluation showed that Aboriginal young people who participated in Deadly Minds reported improved social and emotional wellbeing, stronger cultural identity, and greater willingness to seek help when needed. The program succeeded because it was designed by and for Aboriginal young people, grounded in cultural knowledge, and delivered in culturally safe environments.\n\nResearcher Dr Williams noted: 'This project showed that effective health promotion must start with community perspectives, not with externally designed interventions. Aboriginal young people knew what they needed—our role was to support them to create it.'",

This technology could: produce unlimited idealised images personalised to individual preferences, making them more psychologically impactful; create deepfakes of real people with altered bodies, blurring reality further; reduce effectiveness of current media literacy strategies that focus on identifying editing; and enable new forms of appearance-based harassment and exploitation.\n\nThese implications extend beyond individual body image to collective understanding of human appearance. If AI-generated images become ubiquitous, real human bodies may increasingly seem inadequate by comparison. The psychological mechanisms of internalisation and social comparison would still operate, but against targets that are not even real humans.\n\nHealth promotion must evolve in several ways. First, media literacy education needs to address AI specifically, teaching recognition of AI-generated images and critical thinking about their prevalence. Second, interventions should shift emphasis from critiquing specific images to building robust self-worth less dependent on appearance. Third, advocacy for regulation of AI-generated content, including labelling requirements and restrictions on certain uses, becomes important. Fourth, promoting diverse, authentic human representation becomes more critical as a counterweight to AI perfection. Fifth, supporting young people to critically evaluate their media environment and curate feeds that support wellbeing remains essential.\n\nUltimately, AI-generated imagery intensifies existing challenges rather than creating entirely new ones. The fundamental issue—a culture that overvalues appearance and presents unrealistic standards—persists, with AI adding new tools for its perpetuation.

          "conceptExplanation": "Understanding mental health and body image at an advanced level requires integrating multiple theoretical frameworks, each illuminating different aspects of these complex phenomena.\n\nThe biopsychosocial model provides a necessary foundation, but it can be criticised for underspecifying relationships between factors and for potentially obscuring structural determinants by giving equal weight to all domains. Integrating social determinants of health perspectives highlights how factors like poverty, racism, and housing instability—often beyond individual control—profoundly shape mental health outcomes. This integration has political implications: if mental health problems are largely structural, individual-focused interventions are insufficient, and social change becomes a mental health imperative.\n\nDevelopmental perspectives add crucial temporal dimensions. The differential susceptibility hypothesis proposes that genetically sensitive individuals may be more affected by environmental factors—both negatively (vulnerability) and positively (plasticity). This helps explain why some adolescents exposed to appearance-focused media develop body dissatisfaction while others do not. Adolescence, characterised by heightened neurological sensitivity to social evaluation, may represent a critical period when media effects are particularly powerful.\n\nTheories of media effects have become increasingly sophisticated. Early models proposed direct effects from media exposure to body dissatisfaction. Contemporary models recognise that effects are mediated by psychological processes (internalisation, comparison) and moderated by individual differences (self-esteem, media literacy) and social contexts (peer norms, family attitudes). Objectification theory, developed by feminist psychologists Fredrickson and Roberts, provides a particularly powerful framework. It proposes that environments characterised by sexual objectification lead individuals—particularly women, though increasingly men—to adopt an observer's perspective on their own bodies. This self-objectification is associated with body shame, anxiety, and diminished engagement with internal bodily states.\n\nCritical analysis reveals that body image is not merely an individual psychological phenomenon but is produced through cultural, economic, and political processes. Foucauldian analysis illuminates how beauty standards function as disciplinary mechanisms, producing subjects who internalise surveillance and regulate their own bodies according to norms. The beauty and diet industries profit from body dissatisfaction, creating material interests in perpetuating unrealistic standards. Feminist scholarship has documented how appearance-focused norms function to limit women's opportunities and political power.\n\nPostcolonial perspectives add another layer of analysis. The globalisation of Western beauty ideals occurs within historically produced power relations, with former colonial powers continuing to exercise cultural influence. For Indigenous peoples, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, colonial histories of bodily control have ongoing effects. Decolonising body image involves both critiquing the imposition of Western standards and recovering Indigenous knowledge about bodies and wellbeing.\n\nIntersectionality theory, developed by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, provides essential tools for understanding how multiple identities shape body image experience. A young, disabled, queer woman of colour experiences body image pressures that cannot be captured by simply adding together pressures faced by women, disabled people, queer people, and people of colour. Her experience is shaped by the unique intersection of these identities within systems of power. Health promotion that ignores intersectionality risks reproducing the experiences of the most privileged within any group as universal.\n\nThese theoretical frameworks have practical implications. Critical health promotion moves beyond individual behaviour change to address structural determinants. It involves community participation in defining problems and solutions, attention to power relations, and advocacy for social change. Culturally responsive approaches recognise the diversity of body image experiences and involve affected communities in program development. Evaluation extends beyond individual outcomes to consider community-level and structural changes."

These documents revealed that the company's own research had found that their platform was harmful to teenage girls' body image, with one internal presentation stating that the platform 'makes body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.'\n\nThe documents showed that the company was aware that comparison to unrealistic standards on the platform contributed to eating disorders, depression, and suicidal ideation among young users. However, internal discussions focused on how to manage public relations rather than fundamental platform redesign. Features known to increase body dissatisfaction, like image filters and engagement metrics, were retained because they also increased user engagement and advertising revenue.\n\nThe leak prompted congressional hearings and renewed calls for regulation of social media platforms. However, meaningful regulatory change has been slow, with platforms continuing to profit from engagement-optimising algorithms that researchers argue amplify appearance-related content and comparison.\n\nDr Jasmine Chen, a researcher in digital health, commented: 'This case demonstrates the conflict between corporate profit motives and public health. The platform's business model depends on maximising engagement, and content that triggers social comparison and body dissatisfaction is highly engaging. Without regulatory intervention or alternative platform models, we are relying on corporations to act against their financial interests.'\n\nMeanwhile, young people have developed their own responses. Some engage in 'digital detox' and intentionally curate feeds to exclude appearance-focused content. Others use the same platforms to share body-positive messages and challenge unrealistic standards. Researchers debate whether these individual and grassroots responses can effectively counter the structural power of platform algorithms and the beauty industry.",

Traditional approaches might study body image in women, then body image in people of colour, then body image in disabled people, potentially missing experiences at the intersections. Intersectionality proposes that someone at the intersection of multiple identities—say, a disabled Aboriginal young woman—does not simply experience 'female body image pressures' plus 'Aboriginal body image pressures' plus 'disability body image pressures.' Rather, she experiences a unique configuration of pressures produced by the intersection of these identities within interlocking systems of sexism, racism, and ableism.\n\nThis has several implications. First, research that studies only one dimension at a time may produce findings relevant mainly to the most privileged within that category (e.g., white women in gender studies). Second, interventions based on single-identity research may fail for those at intersections. Third, understanding body image requires attention to systems of power, not just individual psychological processes. An intersectional approach does not simply add more variables to analysis but fundamentally reconceptualises the phenomenon as shaped by structural power relations.",

              "difficulty": "advanced",
              "modelResponse": "The political economy of digital media platforms creates structural conditions that systematically harm body image at a population level. Platforms operate under surveillance capitalism, where user engagement generates data that is sold to advertisers. Algorithms are optimised to maximise engagement, not wellbeing. Content that triggers emotional responses—including the negative emotions produced by social comparison and body dissatisfaction—often generates high engagement. Thus, the business model has no intrinsic mechanism to limit harmful content and indeed incentivises its proliferation.\n\nThe beauty and diet industries, representing hundreds of billions in annual revenue, are major advertisers on these platforms. Their commercial interests lie in producing body dissatisfaction, which drives consumption of their products. Platforms profit from delivering these advertisers access to users experiencing the very dissatisfaction the advertisers cultivate. This creates a symbiotic relationship between platform capitalism and the beauty industry, with body dissatisfaction serving the interests of both.\n\nFoucauldian analysis reveals these platforms as mechanisms of disciplinary power that extend beyond traditional media. Users internalise surveillance, curating and monitoring their own images and bodies for the anticipated gaze of others. This self-surveillance serves platform interests by generating engagement and content, while psychologically harming users through the constant self-objectification it produces.\n\nAddressing these structural determinants requires interventions beyond individual behaviour change. Regulatory approaches might include: mandatory algorithmic transparency, allowing researchers to study how content is amplified; bans on certain advertising practices that target body dissatisfaction; platform liability for harms caused by algorithmic amplification; data protection that limits surveillance capitalism; and public investment in alternative platform models prioritising wellbeing over engagement.\n\nMore fundamental change might require challenging the commodification of attention itself. This could involve: new economic models for digital services not reliant on advertising; democratic governance of digital infrastructure; anti-trust action to reduce platform power; and cultural shifts that devalue appearance-focused social media use. These changes require collective action—social movements, political organising, and perhaps new institutional forms.\n\nCritically, such change must be attentive to power. Regulation drafted by those with interests in the status quo may be ineffective. Platform corporations have substantial lobbying power and influence over political discourse. Genuine change likely requires sustained pressure from affected communities and civil society, holding both corporations and governments accountable.\n\nUltimately, addressing the body image harms of digital platforms is not merely a health issue but a question of democratic governance of powerful technologies. It requires understanding platforms not as neutral tools but as political-economic systems with interests, and mobilising countervailing power to redirect them toward human flourishing.",
