Even if you delete something, someone might have already saved it or shared it. This is why it is good to think before you post.\n\nSocial media can affect how we feel about ourselves. When we see others posting perfect photos and exciting lives, we might feel bad about our own life. But remember - most people only share their best moments online. What you see is not the whole story.\n\nBeing authentic online means being the real you. It means not pretending to be someone else or hiding who you really are. When you are authentic, you feel better about yourself and others trust you more.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, sharing culture and identity online can be a way to connect with community. Many young Indigenous Australians use social media to share language, art, and stories. They show that their identity connects their online and offline worlds."

She begins posting photos that make her look happier and more popular than she really feels. She uses lots of filters to change how she looks. She says yes to things she does not really want to do, just so she can post about them.\n\nOne day, Talia's older cousin Mia visits.

          "conceptExplanation": "Digital identity is the version of yourself that exists online. It is created through everything you do on the internet - the photos you post, the comments you make, the videos you watch, and even the things you search for. Unlike your real-life identity, which people experience face-to-face, your digital identity can be seen by many people at once, and it can last long after you have forgotten about it.\n\nYour digital footprint is particularly important to understand. Every action you take online leaves a trace - like footprints in wet cement. These traces can be difficult or impossible to remove completely. This means that something you post today could affect your reputation in the future, including how universities or employers see you.\n\nSocial media has a powerful influence on identity development. On the positive side, it can help you connect with communities that share your interests, explore different aspects of your identity, and express yourself creatively. However, it can also lead to problems. Research shows that what you do on social media matters more than how much time you spend on it. Passive scrolling and comparing yourself to others tends to have negative effects, while actively connecting with others and sharing authentically can be positive.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, digital platforms can be powerful tools for connecting with culture and community. Many Indigenous Australians use social media to share language, art, stories, and cultural knowledge. Digital spaces can help maintain connections to Country and community, especially for those living away from traditional lands. This shows how digital identity can strengthen, rather than replace, cultural identity.\n\nBeing authentic online does not mean sharing everything about yourself. It means being honest about who you are while making thoughtful choices about what to share. You can be real without revealing all your private information. Finding this balance is an important skill for navigating the digital world safely."

On one app, Jordan posts about gaming achievements. On another, Jordan pretends to be older and more confident than they actually feel. On a third platform, Jordan created a completely fake profile to follow people without being recognised.\n\nLately, Jordan has been feeling confused about who they really are. They notice that their mood changes depending on which app they are using. When Jordan gets lots of likes on the confident persona, they feel great. But when they do not, they feel worse than before. Jordan also worries about what would happen if people from different parts of their life saw the different profiles.\n\nJordan's friend Kai has noticed that Jordan seems stressed.

          "conceptExplanation": "Digital identity has become an increasingly important aspect of adolescent identity development. Research indicates that young Australians aged 8-17 spend an average of 4-6 hours per day using screens, with social media being a primary activity for teenagers. This means that a significant portion of identity exploration and development now happens in digital spaces.\n\nOne of the most important findings from recent research is that how you use social media matters more than how much you use it. Passive consumption - scrolling through feeds without engaging - tends to lead to negative effects like increased social comparison and lower self-esteem. In contrast, active participation - creating content, connecting with friends, and engaging authentically - can actually support positive identity development. This is especially true when young people feel they can express themselves honestly online.\n\nThe concept of context collapse helps explain one of the challenges of online identity management. In person, we naturally adjust how we present ourselves depending on who we are with - we might act differently with close friends than with teachers or grandparents. Online, these different contexts often collapse together. A single post might be seen by all these different audiences at once, making it challenging to manage different aspects of our identity.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, digital platforms offer unique opportunities and challenges. Social media has become an important tool for sharing and celebrating cultural identity, connecting with community across distances, and revitalising language and cultural practices. At the same time, Indigenous young people may navigate code-switching between different online communities - presenting their cultural identity differently depending on the platform and audience. Understanding how digital identity intersects with cultural identity is important for supporting holistic wellbeing.\n\nAuthentic self-presentation does not mean sharing everything about yourself online. It means being genuine about who you are while making thoughtful choices about what to share and with whom. This balance between authenticity and privacy is a key skill for healthy digital citizenship."

She has accounts on multiple social media platforms and has noticed she presents herself quite differently on each one. On TikTok, she shares trendy dance videos and popular music. On Instagram, she posts carefully edited photos that fit current beauty trends. On WhatsApp, she shares cultural content and speaks Somali with extended family members.\n\nRecently, Amara's different online worlds began to collide. A distant relative found her TikTok account and shared one of her dance videos in the family WhatsApp group. Some family members disapproved, and Amara felt embarrassed and conflicted. She also noticed that a classmate had taken screenshots of her Instagram posts and shared them with comments about her appearance.\n\nAmara feels torn between different parts of her identity. She wonders if she needs to choose between being 'culturally appropriate' for her family and 'fitting in' with her Australian peers. She is also starting to question whether either version of herself online reflects who she really is - or who she wants to become.",

            }
          ],
          "conceptExplanation": "The relationship between digital and offline identity is more complex than the simple 'real versus fake' dichotomy often portrayed in media discussions. Contemporary research suggests that digital identity operates through a bidirectional, mutually constitutive relationship with offline identity. The personas we construct online are not merely reflections of a pre-existing 'authentic self' - they actively participate in the ongoing process of identity formation. What we post, how we interact, and the feedback we receive online all contribute to shaping who we understand ourselves to be.\n\nThis understanding has important implications for how we evaluate 'authenticity' online. Rather than asking whether someone's online presence matches some mythical 'true self', we might better ask whether their digital engagement supports healthy identity development and positive wellbeing. Research consistently demonstrates that the quality of social media engagement matters more than quantity. Systematic reviews of studies involving thousands of adolescents reveal that passive consumption of content - scrolling without engaging - correlates with increased social comparison and diminished wellbeing. Conversely, active participation, particularly when it involves authentic self-expression and meaningful connection, can support positive identity outcomes.\n\nThe concept of context collapse provides a useful framework for understanding one of the unique challenges of digital identity management. In face-to-face interactions, we naturally adjust our self-presentation based on context - the 'you' who interacts with close friends differs from the 'you' who speaks to teachers or grandparents. Online, these contexts often collapse. A single post may be simultaneously visible to peers, family, educators, and unknown others. This collapse can create anxiety and prompt defensive self-presentation, but it can also provide opportunities for reflection on the consistency and integrity of one's identity across contexts.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, digital platforms present particular opportunities for cultural identity expression and community connection. Social media has become a significant tool for cultural revitalisation, enabling the sharing of language, art, and cultural knowledge across geographical distances. Research indicates that connection to culture and community is a protective factor for wellbeing among Indigenous young Australians. Digital platforms can support this connection, particularly for those living away from traditional Country or community. However, Indigenous young people may also navigate complex code-switching between different online communities, balancing cultural identity expression with other aspects of their identity.\n\nThe concept of 'performative authenticity' captures an important paradox of digital identity. We often perform authenticity - deliberately constructing posts that appear spontaneous and genuine. This is not necessarily problematic. The key distinction lies between performance that aligns with one's values and supports genuine connection versus performance that creates distance between one's presented and experienced self. The goal is not to eliminate all curation from online presence, but to ensure that digital self-presentation remains in service of authentic identity rather than replacing it."

As someone who identifies as both Aboriginal Australian and gay, Malik has found social media to be both a vital resource and a source of significant stress.\n\nOn some platforms, Malik has connected with other Indigenous LGBTQIA+ young people, finding community and validation for aspects of identity that feel invisible in his rural school. These connections have helped him understand that his cultural identity and sexuality can coexist - something he had struggled with given negative messages from some community members. Online, Malik has encountered Indigenous queer elders who share stories of how sexuality was understood differently before colonisation.\n\nHowever, Malik maintains carefully separated online presences. On platforms connected to his school community, Malik presents as heterosexual and downplays his Indigenous identity. On platforms connected to extended family, he emphasises his Aboriginal identity but hides his sexuality. Only in pseudonymous spaces does Malik feel he can be his full self.\n\nRecently, Malik has begun to feel exhausted by this fragmentation. He notices that managing multiple identities creates constant anxiety about being 'discovered' and prevents him from forming deeper connections on any platform. He has also noticed himself becoming more skilled at self-censorship, which now sometimes extends to face-to-face interactions where he might have previously been more open.",

The connection to passive versus active use becomes clear when we understand that passive consumption maximises exposure to comparison material without the psychological benefits of connection and self-expression. When scrolling passively, users encounter countless curated images and posts that trigger upward social comparisons (comparing to those perceived as 'better off'). Active engagement, by contrast, involves expressing oneself and connecting with others, which shifts focus from comparison to communication. Additionally, active engagement may trigger more realistic comparisons as users recognise the effort that goes into their own posts. This explains why research consistently finds passive use associated with negative wellbeing effects while active use can be neutral or positive.",

Virtual reality social spaces could intensify identity fluidity - when users can present as entirely different physical beings, the connection between embodied and digital identity becomes more complex. This might accelerate the acceptance that identity is performative, potentially liberating some from constraining identity expectations while creating new forms of disconnection from embodied experience. AI-generated content and deepfakes challenge the assumption that digital content represents intentional self-expression - when others can create convincing content appearing to be 'you', identity ownership becomes contested terrain. This might shift focus from controlling one's digital footprint to developing critical evaluation skills and robust offline identity anchors. Most speculatively, brain-computer interfaces that translate thought directly to digital expression could collapse the distinction between considered self-presentation and unfiltered self-expression, creating both radical authenticity and unprecedented vulnerability. The throughline across these scenarios is a potential shift from viewing identity as something we 'have' to something we continuously negotiate across human and technological actors.",

            }
          ],
          "conceptExplanation": "The theoretical landscape of digital identity has evolved significantly since early scholarship, which tended to position online and offline identity as distinct realms. Contemporary frameworks emphasise the interpenetration of digital and embodied experience, viewing identity as continuously constructed through practices that span online and offline contexts. This perspective draws on Judith Butler's (1990) theory of performativity - the idea that identity is not a pre-existing essence that is expressed, but rather something that is brought into being through repeated performative acts. In digital contexts, these performances occur within what danah boyd (2010) characterises as 'networked publics' - spaces structured by distinctive properties: persistence (content remains after posting), replicability (content can be copied), scalability (potential for vast audiences), and searchability (content can be found through search). These properties fundamentally alter the dynamics of self-presentation and identity work.\n\nResearch on digital engagement and psychological wellbeing has moved beyond simple 'screen time' metrics toward more nuanced frameworks. The active-passive engagement paradigm has proven particularly useful for explaining divergent findings about social media and wellbeing. Systematic reviews (Valkenburg et al., 2021) demonstrate that passive consumption - scrolling through feeds without engaging - tends to correlate with negative wellbeing outcomes, particularly through mechanisms of social comparison. Active engagement - creating content, commenting, connecting with others - shows more variable effects, with authentic self-expression and meaningful connection associated with positive outcomes. This distinction suggests that digital engagement is not inherently harmful or beneficial, but that the quality and nature of engagement mediate psychological effects.\n\nFor adolescents navigating identity development (Erikson's 'Identity vs. Role Confusion' stage), digital spaces present both opportunities and challenges. The psychosocial moratorium - Erikson's concept of a culturally sanctioned period for identity exploration - now increasingly includes digital exploration. Young people can explore aspects of identity (interests, values, sexuality, gender expression) with communities that may not exist in their physical environment. For young people with marginalised identities, digital spaces can function as what Fraser (1990) termed 'counter-publics' - spaces for developing identity narratives that challenge dominant discourses.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, digital platforms occupy a complex position in relation to cultural identity. Research indicates that connection to culture is a significant protective factor for wellbeing (Gee et al., 2014). Digital platforms have become important tools for cultural maintenance and revitalisation - sharing language, art, stories, and cultural knowledge across distances. The concept of 'digital diaspora' applies here, as digital technologies enable maintenance of cultural connections despite geographical dispersion from Country. However, this must be understood within the context of ongoing colonisation - digital platforms are predominantly designed within Western frameworks that may not align with Indigenous ways of knowing and being. Young Indigenous Australians navigate these tensions in their digital identity work, code-switching between contexts and negotiating how to represent cultural identity in spaces not designed for such representation.\n\nContext collapse (Marwick & boyd, 2011) represents a key theoretical concept for understanding digital identity challenges. In face-to-face interaction, different social contexts remain relatively separate, allowing for context-appropriate self-presentation. Online, these audiences collapse - a single post may be visible to peers, family, educators, and strangers. This collapse complicates identity management, but can also prompt valuable reflection on the coherence and authenticity of one's self-presentation across contexts. For young people with complex or marginalised identities, context collapse can create particular stress, as maintaining different aspects of identity for different audiences becomes more difficult.\n\nThe concept of 'imagined audience' (Litt, 2012) helps explain how users navigate context collapse. Users construct mental models of who will see their content, though these imagined audiences often diverge from actual audiences. These imagined audiences influence self-presentation choices and may reflect idealised or feared viewers rather than statistical reality. Understanding this gap between imagined and actual audiences has important implications for supporting healthy digital identity development - helping young people develop more accurate models of their digital audiences while also clarifying their values regardless of audience."

Her connection to culture has been disrupted by multiple factors - geographical distance from Country, the intergenerational impacts of the Stolen Generations on her family, and limited access to fluent language speakers in her immediate community.\n\nOver the past two years, Mikayla has used digital platforms as tools for cultural reclamation and identity development. She follows Yindjibarndi language revival accounts, engages with First Nations educators and artists, and participates in Indigenous youth networks. Through these connections, she has begun learning Yindjibarndi language, connected with relatives she did not know existed, and developed pride in her cultural identity.\n\nMikayla has also become a content creator, sharing her journey of cultural reconnection with other young Indigenous people facing similar challenges. Her content explicitly addresses the complexity of identity for urban Indigenous youth, challenging both stereotypical representations of Aboriginality and the deficit narratives common in mainstream media. Her work has attracted a significant following among young First Nations Australians.\n\nHowever, Mikayla navigates ongoing tensions in her digital identity work. Some community members have questioned her authority to speak about culture given her disconnection from Country. She faces criticism both from non-Indigenous audiences who police her Aboriginality and from some Indigenous people who hold different views about appropriate cultural representation online.

Persistence means that identity performances are permanently recorded - an adolescent's early identity experiments remain visible, potentially complicating the natural process of trying on and discarding identity possibilities. Replicability allows identity performances to spread beyond intended contexts, amplifying both positive identity explorations (connecting with like-minded communities) and negative experiences (embarrassing content being shared). Scalability creates the possibility that identity experiments reach vast audiences, which can accelerate both identity validation (finding global communities for niche interests) and identity vulnerability (exposure to criticism at scale). Searchability means that identity performances are findable - past presentations can be discovered by future audiences (employers, partners), creating pressure for what Livingstone calls 'impression management through time'. Together, these properties transform the psychosocial moratorium from a temporary, relatively contained period of exploration into a permanently recorded, potentially globally visible process. This creates unique opportunities - unprecedented access to diverse identity models and communities - alongside unique challenges - unprecedented permanence and reach of developmental missteps.",

Central concepts like relationality - where identity is understood as constituted through relationships with others, ancestors, land, and more-than-human beings - suggest a fundamentally different model than the self-contained individual of Western psychology. This has implications for digital identity: rather than the self being something an individual constructs and presents, identity might be understood as emergent from relational webs that now include digital connections. The Indigenous concept of Country as a determinant of wellbeing challenges the placelessness often assumed in digital identity discourse. Digital diaspora practices suggest that digital technologies might maintain connections to Country across distance - identity remains grounded in place even when physically displaced. This challenges frameworks that treat digital identity as locationless or deterritorialised. Indigenous perspectives on intergenerational connection also offer alternative framings. Where Western developmental psychology tends to focus on individual life-course identity development, Indigenous frameworks foreground connections across generations. Digital technologies might be understood as tools for maintaining these intergenerational identity connections - preserving and transmitting cultural knowledge across time. These alternatives do not simply replace Western frameworks but suggest limitations in conceptualising identity as individual, placeless, and temporally bounded. A synthesised framework might understand digital identity as relationally constituted, place-connected even when digitally mediated, and intergenerationally embedded.",
