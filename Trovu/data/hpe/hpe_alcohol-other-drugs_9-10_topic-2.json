This shapes young people's expectations by making drinking seem normal, desirable, and necessary for good times. Sponsorship of sports normalises alcohol in contexts young people engage with. Social media shows drinking in positive lights without consequences. Research shows exposure to alcohol marketing increases likelihood of drinking and drinking more.

          "sampleAnswer": "Laws have some effectiveness: age restrictions reduce youth drinking somewhat; drink-driving laws and RBT have significantly reduced road deaths; RSA reduces serving to intoxicated people. However, limitations exist: age restrictions are easily circumvented through secondary supply; guidelines are recommendations with no enforcement; marketing continues to target young people; cultural norms often override guidelines; heavy drinking remains socially acceptable. Evidence suggests pricing (minimum unit pricing) and advertising restrictions would be more effective but face industry opposition. Current approach relies heavily on individual responsibility while maintaining alcohol availability and promotion. More comprehensive approaches (as with tobacco) would likely be more effective but are politically difficult. Current framework is moderate - better than nothing but falls short of evidence-based best practice."

Cultural normalisation means drinking is embedded in social life, leading to frequent use. Legal status doesn't reflect harm - alcohol is genuinely harmful but was legal before modern understanding of its effects. The alcohol industry's political influence prevents stronger regulation.

Marketing works by associating alcohol with desirable outcomes (fun, friendship, success) and normalising drinking as part of good times. Young people are particularly susceptible because they're forming attitudes and behaviours and respond to lifestyle associations. Digital marketing reaches young audiences directly through social media. The relationship is dose-dependent - more exposure leads to more drinking. This is why stricter marketing regulations would reduce youth drinking."

Historical factors: tobacco harm was established first, giving alcohol industry time to position against similar regulation. Industry influence: alcohol industry is politically powerful through donations, lobbying, and integration with sports. Cultural embedding: drinking is more socially normalised than smoking; restrictions seem more intrusive. Framing: tobacco framed as inherently harmful; alcohol framed as only harmful when 'misused,' allowing responsible drinking narrative. Economic interests: alcohol generates significant tax revenue and employment. Self-regulation compromise: allows government to appear active without industry opposition. Public opinion: majority support for tobacco restrictions developed over decades of education; alcohol hasn't had equivalent campaigns. Result is inconsistent policy - evidence supports stricter alcohol marketing regulation, but political barriers prevent it. This illustrates how public health policy is shaped by interests and politics, not just evidence."

          "question": "Explain the relationship between social determinants and the alcohol harm paradox.",
          "sampleAnswer": "Social determinants create the alcohol harm paradox through multiple pathways. Lower socioeconomic status means: poorer baseline health, so alcohol causes more damage to already compromised systems; fewer resources to buffer harm (healthcare access, social support, stable housing); co-occurring stressors that compound alcohol effects; less access to treatment when problems develop; environments with higher outlet density and cheaper alcohol. So even though disadvantaged people drink less, each drink causes more harm. This illustrates why individual-focused approaches are insufficient - the social context shapes how harmful alcohol is, requiring population-level interventions addressing the determinants."

          "sampleAnswer": "Evidence clearly supports policies (pricing, marketing restrictions, availability limits) that are politically difficult to implement. Several factors create this tension: Industry influence - alcohol industry makes political donations, employs lobbyists, threatens job losses. This gives them disproportionate policy influence. Cultural embedding - alcohol is socially normalised; restrictions seem to target something 'normal.' Politicians fear voter backlash. Federalism - different jurisdictions complicate coordinated action. Revenue - governments benefit from alcohol taxes, creating conflicting interests. Short-term thinking - political cycles favour avoiding controversy over long-term health gains. Framing dominance - 'personal responsibility' and 'nanny state' frames have captured public discourse, making public health framing seem paternalistic. Counter-forces include: public health advocacy; international evidence; economic burden evidence; youth protection concerns. Resolution requires: reframing as protecting children and communities rather than restricting adults; building coalitions; incremental approaches that demonstrate safety; long-term community education. Evidence alone is insufficient - political strategy is necessary to translate evidence into policy."

          "sampleAnswer": "The capability approach, developed by Sen and Nussbaum, focuses on what people are able to do and be - their capabilities and functionings. From this perspective, alcohol affects wellbeing by: potentially enabling some capabilities (social connection, relaxation); but more significantly limiting capabilities (health affects ability to function; addiction limits autonomy and agency; intoxication impairs practical reasoning; violence affects others' capabilities). The approach would also examine how social structures affect people's capability to make healthy choices about alcohol. Heavy drinking significantly limits capabilities across multiple domains, suggesting support for policies that protect and enhance capabilities."

          "sampleAnswer": "Commercial determinants analysis examines how industry activities shape health: Marketing and promotion - creates demand, normalises consumption, targets growth demographics, uses social media to evade restrictions. Political activity - lobbying against effective regulation, political donations, shaping public discourse. Product development - products designed for appeal (alcopops, craft aesthetics) and profit (high strength cheap alcohol). Pricing strategies - promotional pricing increases consumption. CSR activities - 'responsible drinking' campaigns that don't reduce drinking but provide political cover. Research funding - creating doubt about evidence for harmful effects. The framework shows that individual drinking 'choices' occur within an environment systematically shaped by commercial interests, challenging purely individual-responsibility approaches."

          "sampleAnswer": "Multiple factors explain this: Cultural embedding - alcohol is more socially integrated than tobacco ever was; wine traditions, beer cultures, spirits ceremonies create resistance. Different harm narrative - tobacco kills users directly; alcohol harm is more complex (some moderate use, harm often to others). Industry positioning - alcohol industry learned from tobacco's mistakes; embedded in food, hospitality, tourism, sport; presents as responsible partner. Economic interests - alcohol is significant economic sector with jobs, taxes, tourism; trade implications more complex. Regulatory complexity - many products, different risks, cultural variation makes one-size-fits-all harder. Public opinion - less public support for alcohol restrictions than tobacco. WHO capacity - limited resources; tobacco success took decades. Result is weaker voluntary Global Strategy rather than binding convention. Analysis suggests political economy rather than evidence drives the difference."

          "question": "Evaluate the argument that if adults can consent to drinking alcohol despite health risks, they should be able to consent to other drug use too.",
          "sampleAnswer": "The argument highlights an inconsistency: alcohol causes significant harm but is legal while less harmful drugs are prohibited. From liberal autonomy perspective, there's no principled basis for different treatment if both involve informed adult consent. However, several considerations complicate this: addiction undermines autonomy for both, but differently for different drugs; different pharmacological profiles affect capacity; historical and cultural factors shaped current law, not risk assessment; practical factors differ (administering, overdose risk); second-order effects on society differ. The strongest response isn't that alcohol should remain legal while other drugs stay illegal, but rather: current alcohol policy is insufficiently restrictive given evidence, AND drug policy should be reformed to be more consistent and evidence-based across all substances. The argument reveals incoherence in current approach rather than necessarily supporting any particular resolution."

          "question": "Develop an ethical framework for evaluating whether alcohol companies should be permitted to partner with public health organisations.",
          "sampleAnswer": "Framework questions: 1) Conflict of interest: Does partnership constrain criticism or advocacy? Does it provide cover for harmful activities? Is the partner institutionally captured? 2) Evidence of benefit: Does partnership demonstrably improve health outcomes? Would those outcomes occur anyway? Are there opportunity costs? 3) Alternatives: Could the same goals be achieved without industry involvement? What's lost by refusing partnership? 4) Transparency: Are terms public? Is industry influence disclosed? Can the partner exit if needed? 5) Power analysis: Who benefits most? Does partnership legitimise industry role in policy? 6) Reputational effects: Does partnership normalise industry? Does it compromise partner's credibility? Applying framework: Most alcohol industry partnerships would fail this test because: they provide legitimacy without evidence of health benefit; alternatives usually exist; industry benefits more from reputation boost; partnerships constrain advocacy. Conclusion: strong presumption against partnership; exceptional circumstances only; ongoing evaluation required."

The campaigns don't define 'moderate' clearly, don't challenge cultural norms, and don't reduce consumption. They reframe the problem away from product and marketing toward individual behaviour.

          "question": "Critically synthesise ethical frameworks to develop a comprehensive justification for (or against) strong government regulation of alcohol."
          "sampleAnswer": "Synthesis for strong regulation: Utilitarian - aggregate harm from alcohol exceeds benefits; regulation reduces total suffering; evidence shows effective policies exist. Liberal harm principle - alcohol causes substantial harm to others (violence, accidents, family harm), justifying restriction; even self-harm arguments support some paternalism where addiction undermines autonomy. Capability approach - heavy drinking limits multiple capabilities; regulation protects capabilities and creates conditions for flourishing. Justice - current policy concentrates harm among disadvantaged; industry profits while society pays; stronger regulation is more just distribution. Democratic legitimacy - current policy influenced by industry interests, not public; reform represents democratic correction. Against over-regulation: some autonomy limits appropriate - adults can make risk decisions; prohibition's failures show some limits on restriction; pleasure has value; and cultural practices deserve some protection. Synthesis conclusion: Strong regulation justified on multiple ethical grounds, but should preserve meaningful choice within constraints designed to reduce aggregate harm and protect vulnerable groups. Current policy fails by multiple ethical standards."
