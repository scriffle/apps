Grooming can happen in person or online. It often feels confusing because the person seems nice and caring.

          "content": "Countries take different approaches to child protection. Some emphasise state intervention (child protection orientation), while others prioritise family support (family service orientation). Nordic countries often combine universal services with targeted support. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides a rights-based framework that most countries have ratified. Ethical considerations in child protection include: balancing protection with privacy, respecting cultural diversity while upholding universal rights, involving children in decisions about their lives, and ensuring systems don't retraumatise those seeking help."

Innovations include: technology for prevention education and disclosure; trauma-informed approaches throughout systems; participation of people with lived experience in designing responses; and community-based prevention initiatives. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing research, adaptation, and youth involvement in solution design."
