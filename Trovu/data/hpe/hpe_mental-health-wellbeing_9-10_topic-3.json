Everyone faces hard times—like family problems, friendship issues, or school stress. Resilience helps us get through these tough times and come out okay on the other side.\n\nResilience isn't something you're born with or without. It's more like a muscle that gets stronger with practice. Some people might seem naturally resilient, but they've usually had lots of practice dealing with challenges. The good news is that everyone can build their resilience skills.\n\nBeing resilient doesn't mean you don't feel sad, angry, or upset when bad things happen. It's normal and healthy to have these feelings. Resilience is about finding ways to cope with these feelings and keep moving forward, even when it's hard."

There are many different strategies, and what works for one person might not work for another. The key is finding what helps you.\n\nHealthy coping strategies include talking to someone you trust about how you're feeling, doing physical activity like walking or playing sport, spending time on hobbies or activities you enjoy, getting enough sleep and eating well, and taking breaks when you feel overwhelmed.\n\nSome coping strategies might seem to help at first but can actually make things worse over time. These include ignoring problems hoping they'll go away, spending too much time on screens to avoid feelings, being mean to others, or using substances like alcohol or drugs. If you notice you're using unhealthy strategies, try replacing them with healthier ones."

A friend might cheer you up when you're sad, while a parent might help solve a practical problem. It's good to have different people you can turn to for different kinds of support.\n\nBuilding your support network takes time. You can strengthen relationships by being a good listener yourself, spending quality time with people, being honest and trustworthy, and showing appreciation for others. Remember, relationships are two-way—being there for others helps them be there for you."

Instead of thinking about everything you need to do, focus on just the next small step.\n\nSetting small, achievable goals helps build confidence. Each time you complete a small goal, you prove to yourself that you can do hard things. This builds your belief in yourself, which is an important part of resilience.\n\nRemember that setbacks are normal. If you try something and it doesn't work, that's not failure—it's learning. Ask yourself what you can learn from what happened and what you might try differently next time. Being kind to yourself when things go wrong is an important resilience skill."

It means paying attention to the present moment without judgment. Simple mindfulness activities include focusing on your breathing for a few minutes, noticing five things you can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste, or doing an activity slowly and with full attention."

Resilient people still experience distress and difficulty, but they have developed ways to cope effectively and continue functioning.\n\nResearchers have identified several key factors that contribute to resilience in young people. These include having caring and supportive relationships, the ability to make realistic plans and take action, a positive view of yourself and confidence in your strengths, skills in communication and problem-solving, and the ability to manage strong feelings and impulses.\n\nResilience develops over time through experiences. When we face challenges and find ways to get through them, we build skills and confidence for future challenges. This is why it's important to face difficulties rather than always avoiding them—each challenge is an opportunity to build resilience."

            "content": "Coping strategies can be grouped into different types, each useful for different situations. Problem-focused coping involves taking action to change or fix the situation causing stress. This might include making a plan, gathering information, or asking for help. This works best when the situation is something you can actually change.\n\nEmotion-focused coping involves managing your emotional response to stress. This might include talking about your feelings, using relaxation techniques, or finding ways to distract yourself. This is useful when you can't change the situation and need to manage how you feel about it.\n\nSocial coping involves seeking support from others. This might include talking to friends or family, asking for advice, or just spending time with people who care about you. Social support is one of the most powerful coping resources available.\n\nMeaning-focused coping involves finding purpose or meaning in difficult experiences. This might include looking for lessons or growth opportunities, or connecting the experience to your values and beliefs. This helps make sense of difficult experiences."

They act like a buffer, protecting you from the full impact of difficulties. Key protective factors include strong family connections and support, positive friendships and peer relationships, connection to school and community, good emotional regulation skills, and a sense of purpose or hope for the future.\n\nRisk factors are conditions that make someone more vulnerable to the negative effects of stress. These might include family conflict or instability, social isolation or bullying, previous trauma or adverse experiences, poor coping skills, and lack of access to support services.\n\nWhile you can't always control risk factors, you can work on building protective factors. The more protective factors you have, the better equipped you are to handle adversity. Think of protective factors like shields that help protect you from life's challenges."

            "content": "Good problem-solving skills are central to resilience. When faced with a challenge, a structured approach can help you work through it effectively. The first step is to identify the problem clearly—what exactly is the issue?\n\nNext, brainstorm possible solutions without judging them yet. Come up with as many ideas as you can. Then evaluate each option by considering the pros and cons, what resources you'd need, and what the likely outcomes would be.\n\nChoose the best option and create a plan of action. Break it down into manageable steps. Implement your plan, and then reflect on how it went. Did it work? What could you do differently next time?\n\nRemember that not every problem can be solved, and that's okay. Sometimes the best outcome is accepting a situation while managing your response to it. Problem-solving includes knowing when to shift from trying to change a situation to managing your feelings about it."

            "content": "A strong support network is one of the most important protective factors for resilience. Your network includes formal supports like counsellors, teachers, or health professionals, and informal supports like family, friends, and community members.\n\nDifferent people provide different types of support. Emotional support involves listening, caring, and encouragement. Practical support involves concrete help like giving you a ride or lending you money. Informational support involves advice, guidance, or information. Companionship support involves spending time together and shared activities.\n\nBuilding your network requires investment. This means maintaining relationships during good times, not just reaching out when you need help. It involves being a good support for others too—relationships are reciprocal. It also means being willing to ask for help when you need it, which can be hard but is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nIn Australian communities, support networks often extend to include neighbours, sporting clubs, religious groups, and community organisations. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, connection to community, culture, and Country is a vital source of strength and support."

She joined an online community of other teens with similar conditions, which helped her feel less alone. She was honest with her close friends about what she was going through, and they were more supportive than she expected.\n\nOver time, Mia found meaning in her experience.

            "content": "Resilience research has evolved significantly over the decades. Early researchers viewed resilience as a rare quality possessed by exceptional individuals. However, contemporary understanding recognises resilience as an ordinary adaptive capacity that can be developed by anyone.\n\nThe ecological model of resilience, developed by researchers like Michael Ungar, emphasises that resilience is not just about individual traits but about the interaction between individuals and their environments. This model highlights that communities and systems play a crucial role in providing resources that enable resilience.\n\nAnn Masten's research describes resilience as 'ordinary magic'—the result of basic human adaptational systems working effectively. These systems include attachment relationships with caregivers, self-regulation skills, agency and mastery motivation, meaning-making and coherence, and community connections.\n\nThe developmental perspective on resilience recognises that what builds resilience changes across the lifespan. During adolescence, key resilience factors include developing autonomy and identity, forming supportive peer relationships, engaging in meaningful activities, and developing future orientation and hope."

            "title": "Evidence-Based Coping Strategies",
            "content": "Research has identified several coping strategies that consistently show positive outcomes. Cognitive reappraisal involves changing how you think about a situation to alter its emotional impact. For example, viewing a failed test as a learning opportunity rather than a catastrophe. Studies show this strategy effectively reduces negative emotions.\n\nActive problem-solving involves taking concrete steps to address the source of stress. This includes defining the problem clearly, generating alternatives, evaluating options, implementing solutions, and reviewing outcomes. This approach is most effective for controllable stressors.\n\nSeeking social support is consistently associated with better outcomes. This includes emotional support (empathy, care), instrumental support (practical help), informational support (advice, guidance), and belonging support (shared activities). Different sources of support may be appropriate for different situations.\n\nMindfulness-based strategies involve paying attention to present-moment experiences with acceptance. Research demonstrates benefits for stress reduction, emotional regulation, and overall wellbeing. Techniques include focused breathing, body scans, and mindful awareness practices.\n\nBehavioural activation involves engaging in meaningful and enjoyable activities, particularly when experiencing low mood. Maintaining routines, physical activity, and social connections helps prevent withdrawal and supports recovery."

            "content": "While adversity can cause distress and difficulty, research has also documented that many people experience positive psychological changes following challenging life experiences. This phenomenon is called post-traumatic growth.\n\nPost-traumatic growth can manifest in several domains: enhanced appreciation for life, recognising new possibilities, improved relationships with others, greater personal strength, and spiritual or existential development. It's important to note that growth and distress can coexist—experiencing growth doesn't mean the event wasn't difficult.\n\nCertain factors facilitate post-traumatic growth, including cognitive processing of the experience (making sense of what happened), social support and disclosure, allowing oneself to be vulnerable, drawing on cultural and spiritual resources, and taking time for reflection.\n\nIt's important not to pressure people to 'grow' from their difficulties or to minimise genuine suffering. Growth is not universal, and its absence doesn't indicate failure. The concept simply acknowledges that human responses to adversity are complex and can include positive transformation alongside struggle."

Consider: What strategies do you currently use? How well do they work? What resources are available to you? Are there gaps in your coping toolkit? What skills could you develop?\n\nBuilding coping resources is an ongoing process.

In Australia's multicultural society, it's important to recognise that coping strategies and support systems vary among different cultural groups.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, resilience is deeply connected to culture, community, and Country. The concept of social and emotional wellbeing encompasses connections to body, mind, family, community, culture, Country, and spirit. Strengthening these connections builds resilience.\n\nDadirri, a deep listening practice from the Ngangikurungkurr people of the Northern Territory, exemplifies Indigenous approaches to coping and healing. It involves quiet, still awareness and connection to the land and ancestors. Many Aboriginal communities draw on cultural practices, ceremony, and connection to Elders as sources of strength and healing.\n\nFor people from migrant and refugee backgrounds, resilience may involve maintaining cultural identity while adapting to new contexts, drawing on family and community connections, accessing culturally appropriate services, using religious or spiritual practices, and connecting with others who share similar experiences.\n\nCulturally responsive approaches to resilience recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Effective support acknowledges and builds on the cultural strengths and resources that individuals and communities already possess."

Michael Rutter's stress-buffering model proposes that protective factors moderate the relationship between risk and outcomes—they don't prevent exposure to risk but reduce its negative impact.\n\nThe developmental cascade model, advanced by Ann Masten and colleagues, examines how competence in one domain (such as academic skills) spreads to influence competence in other domains (such as peer relationships), creating cascading effects across development. This highlights how building resilience in one area can have flow-on effects.\n\nMichael Ungar's social ecology of resilience emphasises that resilience depends on both individual capacity and the availability of resources in the environment. His research across multiple countries demonstrates that what constitutes resilience is culturally and contextually specific—there is no universal definition.\n\nThe dual continua model of mental health, developed by Corey Keyes, proposes that mental health and mental illness are related but distinct dimensions. One can experience mental illness while still having aspects of positive mental health, and vice versa. This framework has implications for resilience, suggesting that building positive mental health is a distinct but important complement to reducing symptoms of distress."

In resilient individuals, this system activates when needed but returns to baseline effectively.\n\nChronic or extreme stress can alter brain development, particularly in regions involved in emotional regulation (prefrontal cortex) and threat detection (amygdala). The adolescent brain is particularly sensitive to stress due to ongoing development. However, the brain's plasticity also means that positive experiences can support recovery and growth.\n\nNeurobiological protective factors include genetic variations that influence stress reactivity, early secure attachment experiences that shape stress response systems, and skills and practices that promote regulation (such as mindfulness, which has been shown to alter brain function and structure).\n\nThe concept of allostatic load refers to the cumulative physiological toll of chronic stress on the body. Understanding this helps explain why persistent adversity without adequate support can have lasting health impacts, and why building resilience and providing supportive environments is so important."

            "content": "Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model of stress and coping remains influential. It proposes that stress arises from the relationship between person and environment—specifically, when demands are appraised as exceeding resources. Coping is the process of managing these demands.\n\nPrimary appraisal involves evaluating whether a situation is irrelevant, benign-positive, or stressful. If stressful, it's further appraised as harm/loss (damage already done), threat (anticipated harm), or challenge (potential for growth). Secondary appraisal involves evaluating available coping resources and options.\n\nCoping strategies are then selected based on these appraisals. Problem-focused coping is typically used when the situation is appraised as changeable; emotion-focused coping when it is not. Effective copers can flexibly match their strategies to situational demands.\n\nRecent extensions of this model include proactive coping (anticipating and preparing for future stressors), collective coping (group-level responses to shared stressors), and communal coping (reframing individual problems as shared concerns).\n\nThe concept of coping flexibility emphasises that rigid adherence to any single strategy is less adaptive than being able to adjust approaches based on feedback about what's working."

Critical evaluation considers evidence of effectiveness from rigorous research, particularly randomised controlled trials. Programs should demonstrate measurable improvements in resilience-related outcomes.\n\nTheoretical grounding is important—effective programs are based on sound theory about how resilience develops and can be strengthened. Components typically include skill-building (such as emotional regulation, problem-solving, cognitive restructuring), relationship-building (strengthening connections with supportive others), and meaning-making (developing purpose, values, and hope).\n\nImplementation quality matters—even well-designed programs can fail if not implemented as intended. Factors include facilitator training, program fidelity, dosage, and participant engagement.\n\nCultural appropriateness is essential. Programs developed in one context may not translate effectively to others. Indigenous communities, for instance, have critiqued Western resilience frameworks that emphasise individual traits over collective and cultural factors. Effective programs build on existing cultural strengths.\n\nIn Australia, evidence-based resilience programs include MindMatters, KidsMatter (now Be You), and various programs developed specifically for Indigenous communities that centre cultural connection and community strengths."

The concern about individualisation is that focusing on individual resilience can divert attention from structural factors that create adversity. Expecting individuals to be 'resilient' to poverty, discrimination, or violence can become a way of accepting rather than challenging these conditions.\n\nThe equity critique notes that coping resources are not equally distributed. Socioeconomic disadvantage, discrimination, and marginalisation limit access to protective factors. It's unfair to expect the same outcomes from people facing vastly different circumstances.\n\nThe normalisation concern is that resilience discourse can normalise adversity as an inevitable part of life that individuals must cope with, rather than as preventable harm that should be addressed. This can particularly affect marginalised groups who face systemic inequities.\n\nA social justice approach to resilience focuses on removing unnecessary sources of adversity (primary prevention), ensuring equitable access to protective resources, recognising and building on community and cultural strengths, addressing systemic barriers to wellbeing, and supporting collective action and social change.\n\nThis perspective reframes resilience not just as an individual capacity but as a shared responsibility. Building resilience involves both supporting individuals and working toward a more just society."

Strong cultural identity and practice, connection to Country and ancestral lands, relationships with family, kin, and community, and access to traditional knowledge and ceremony are all protective factors.\n\nCommunity-controlled programs that centre Indigenous leadership and knowledge show promise. For example, programs that support connection to Country through on-Country camps and activities, intergenerational knowledge transmission, and cultural healing practices have demonstrated positive outcomes.\n\nThese approaches challenge Western individualistic models of resilience. They demonstrate that healing and strength are collective processes rooted in culture, relationships, and connection to land.

            "content": "Poststructural and critical scholars have interrogated the resilience concept, revealing its ideological dimensions. Foucauldian analysis examines resilience as a form of governmentality—a way that neoliberal societies encourage individuals to manage themselves, taking responsibility for their own wellbeing regardless of structural conditions. This self-governance aligns with reduced state welfare and increased individual responsibility.\n\nThe critical psychologist David Frayne argues that resilience discourse can serve to 'psychologise' political problems. Rather than addressing poverty, inequality, or discrimination, the focus shifts to making individuals psychologically robust enough to endure these conditions. This represents a profound depoliticisation of social problems.\n\nFeminist scholars like Judith Butler have examined vulnerability as a universal human condition rather than something to be overcome through resilience. Butler argues that recognising shared vulnerability can be the basis for ethical relationships and social solidarity, whereas resilience discourse can mask and reinforce inequalities.\n\nDecolonial perspectives critique resilience frameworks developed in Western, individualistic contexts. Indigenous scholars like Professor Pat Dudgeon emphasise that wellbeing for First Nations peoples is fundamentally relational and collective, centred on connections to Country, culture, community, and spirituality. Imposed Western resilience frameworks can be another form of cultural colonisation."

The positivist paradigm treats resilience as a measurable phenomenon that can be studied objectively. It seeks to identify risk factors, protective factors, and measurable outcomes. This approach has generated substantial empirical research but may oversimplify complex phenomena.\n\nThe interpretive paradigm emphasises understanding resilience from participants' perspectives. Qualitative research explores how people make meaning of their experiences and what resilience means to them in their specific contexts. This approach reveals the diversity of resilience experiences but may lack generalisability.\n\nThe critical paradigm examines resilience in relation to power, inequality, and social justice. It asks whose interests are served by resilience discourse, how resilience is defined and by whom, and what structural factors are obscured by focusing on individual resilience.\n\nThe complexity paradigm views resilience as an emergent property of complex adaptive systems. This approach, advanced by theorists like Michael Ungar, examines how resilience arises from dynamic interactions between individuals and multiple levels of their environment. It challenges linear cause-and-effect thinking in favour of understanding patterns of interaction.\n\nIntegrative frameworks attempt to bridge these paradigms. For example, the pathways to resilience approach developed by Ungar combines quantitative measurement with qualitative understanding, situated within attention to context and power."

Longitudinal designs are essential for understanding how resilience develops over time, but they are resource-intensive and face attrition challenges. Prospective studies that track individuals before and after adversity are ideal but difficult to conduct.\n\nMeasurement issues include defining and operationalising resilience—is it the absence of pathology, the presence of positive adaptation, or both? Various scales exist, including the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, and context-specific measures. Each captures different aspects of the construct.\n\nVariable-focused approaches examine statistical relationships between predictors (risk and protective factors) and outcomes. Person-focused approaches identify patterns or trajectories of adaptation among individuals. Both are valuable for understanding resilience at different levels of analysis.\n\nMixed methods designs combining quantitative measurement with qualitative inquiry offer comprehensive understanding. The qualitative component can illuminate the 'how' and 'why' behind statistical patterns and reveal aspects not captured by standardised measures.\n\nCommunity-based participatory research (CBPR) involves community members as partners throughout the research process. This approach is particularly important for research with marginalised communities and aligns with social justice values.
