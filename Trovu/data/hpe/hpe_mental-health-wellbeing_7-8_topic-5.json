When young people learn to seek help early, problems are addressed before they become severe, reducing the long-term burden on mental health services.

As more people openly discuss mental health, it becomes normalised, encouraging others who might be struggling to reach out. Schools and families that support help-seeking create environments where early intervention is possible. Over time, this creates a community where mental health is treated like physical health - where seeking help is seen as responsible self-care rather than a sign of weakness.

Traditional treatment models wait for problems to develop and then intervene, which is reactive and reaches people only after they're struggling. A prevention model with peer support and mental health promotion creates environments where problems are less likely to develop and are addressed early when they do. This shift involves: building mental health literacy so everyone can recognise early signs; training peer supporters to provide immediate, accessible first response; creating cultures where help-seeking is normalised; addressing social determinants that contribute to poor mental health; and empowering communities to support their own wellbeing. The implications are significant: reduced demand on specialist services, better outcomes through early intervention, decreased stigma, and improved community resilience.

Currently, our reactive, treatment-focused system places responsibility on individuals to recognise problems and navigate complex systems to get help. A promotion paradigm would position mental health like public health—where society invests in creating conditions for wellbeing, not just treating illness. This shift would mean: schools prioritising mental health literacy alongside academic learning; workplaces designing for psychological safety; urban planning considering mental health impacts; policy makers analysing mental health consequences of decisions. Help-seeking would become one strategy within a broader ecosystem of support, rather than the primary response to distress. Mental health would be understood as existing on a continuum where everyone benefits from promotion, rather than a binary of 'ill' and 'well'. This reconceptualisation challenges stigma by normalising mental health as part of human experience. It raises questions of social justice—if poor mental health is partly produced by inequality, poverty, and discrimination, then addressing these becomes mental health work. Ultimately, this paradigm recognises that the conditions for mental health are created collectively, and therefore responsibility for mental health must be shared.",
