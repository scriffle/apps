Distraction (phones, passengers, GPS, food) takes attention from the road - at 60km/h, looking at your phone for 2 seconds means travelling 33 metres blind. Speeding reduces time to react and massively increases crash severity. Emotions (anger, stress, excitement) affect decision-making.

Australia performs in the middle of high-income countries (around 5/100,000), with room for improvement. International comparison helps identify effective interventions, but context matters - what works in Sweden may need adaptation for Australian conditions (distances, climate, settlement patterns)."

The Haddon Matrix analyses factors in pre-crash (what causes crashes), crash (what determines injury severity), and post-crash (what affects outcomes after injury) phases, across human, vehicle, and environment dimensions. Research shows interactions between factors - fatigue plus alcohol has multiplicative effects. Social determinants affect safety - lower socioeconomic areas often have higher crash rates. Medical research shows even 'minor' crashes can cause lasting harm. Understanding causation complexity informs better policy by targeting multiple factors simultaneously."

Mobility as a Service integrates modes but creates data privacy questions. Each technology brings potential safety benefits and new risks.

Vision Zero and the Safe System include equity - everyone deserves safety - but implementation often prioritises areas with more political voice.
