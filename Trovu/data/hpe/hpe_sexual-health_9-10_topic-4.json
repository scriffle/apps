This may or may not match their assigned sex.\n\nGender expression: How someone shows their gender outwardly (clothing, hair, behaviour).

Most people are cisgender.\n\nTransgender: Gender identity differs from assigned sex at birth.\n- Transgender woman: Assigned male at birth, identifies as a woman\n- Transgender man: Assigned female at birth, identifies as a man\n- Some transgender people medically transition; many don't\n- Being transgender is not a choice or mental illness\n\nNon-binary: Identifies as neither exclusively male nor female. May identify as:\n- Both male and female\n- Neither male nor female\n- A different gender entirely\n- Fluid between genders\n\nGender fluid: Gender identity shifts over time or in different contexts.\n\nIntersex: Born with sex characteristics that don't fit typical male or female categories.

Symbolically, legal recognition signals that LGBTQ+ people are valued members of society, which improves self-worth and reduces shame.

Ongoing issues include: transgender people still face significant discrimination, healthcare barriers, and inconsistent legal recognition; intersex people lack adequate protections; conversion practices remain legal in some places; religious exemptions allow discrimination; casual homophobia and transphobia persist in schools, workplaces, and public spaces; some communities remain less accepting; and LGBTQ+ people with intersecting marginalised identities face compounded challenges not solved by marriage. Additionally, rights can be rolled back - they require ongoing defence. The framing also centres certain LGBTQ+ experiences (white, cisgender, coupled) while ignoring others. Advocacy must continue to address structural discrimination, healthcare access, youth support, and changing social attitudes, not just legal benchmarks."

Positive, accurate representation can increase acceptance by humanising LGBTQ+ people and normalising diversity. Negative coverage - sensationalism, platforming extremes, moral panic narratives - can increase hostility by activating fear and prejudice. Media also sets the agenda for public discussion, determining which issues are seen as important. Social media creates filter bubbles where people see content matching existing views. The relationship is bidirectional - media reflects and shapes attitudes. Media literacy is crucial for navigating this landscape."

          "sampleAnswer": "'Gender ideology' is a term created by opponents of LGBTQ+ rights and gender equality to present diverse perspectives as a unified, dangerous ideology being imposed on society. Critical evaluation: The term is strategically vague - it conflates feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, and gender studies without defining what it actually means. It frames established scientific understanding of gender as ideological while presenting opposition as neutral 'common sense.' It enables moral panic by suggesting children are being indoctrinated. It originated in conservative religious contexts but is presented as secular concern. It ignores that all societies have 'gender ideology' - concepts about what gender means and how it should be organised. It deflects from evidence about gender diversity and wellbeing. It creates false equivalence between evidence-based approaches and ideological opposition. Understanding this framing as a rhetorical strategy helps counter it."

The course explores how contemporary Indigenous LGBTQ+ people navigate Western LGBTQ+ frameworks alongside traditional understandings like Two-Spirit, Sistergirl, and Brotherboy. Some students argue that 'LGBTQ+' is itself a colonial framework being imposed globally, while others argue universal human rights should apply everywhere. The course considers how to respectfully engage with Indigenous knowledge while avoiding both cultural appropriation and denial of Indigenous LGBTQ+ experiences.",

This supports arguments that rights shouldn't depend on choice and validates people's experiences as genuine. Constructionism views sexuality as shaped by culture and history - categories like 'gay' are socially created. This challenges claims about what's 'natural' and explains cross-cultural variation. The tension: essentialism may oversimplify and not match all experiences; constructionism can seem to invalidate identity. Many scholars now combine elements - acknowledging biological factors while recognising social shaping of categories and experiences."

          "sampleAnswer": "Taking a marriage equality campaign: queer theory would critique how the campaign sought inclusion in a heteronormative institution rather than challenging why the state privileges certain relationships. It would examine which LGBTQ+ people were centred (often white, middle-class, gender-conforming couples) and who was marginalised. It would question whether 'we're just like you' messaging reinforces rather than challenges norms. It might ask whether resources would have been better spent on issues affecting more marginalised community members. However, it would also acknowledge the real benefits achieved and the strategic context. Queer theory doesn't necessarily oppose such campaigns but prompts critical examination of their assumptions and limitations."

Does research benefit them? Historical harm - context of pathologising research. Potential misuse - prenatal testing, selection, or 'therapy.' Essentialising - research may reinforce biological determinism, ignoring social factors. Complexity - sexuality is likely polygenic and influenced by environment; simple 'gay gene' narratives oversimplify. Privacy - genetic data security. Different community views - some welcome biological evidence; others are concerned. Analysis: research isn't inherently wrong but requires community involvement, careful ethics, and attention to how findings might be used."

          "sampleAnswer": "Valid points in this critique: LGBTQ+ categories emerged from Western history; identity frameworks differ cross-culturally; some Indigenous cultures have own gender/sexuality concepts; rights discourse can be used for Western political agendas; local activists may be dismissed if not using Western frameworks. Counter-arguments: people everywhere experience same-sex attraction and gender diversity even if concepts differ; opposing 'Western influence' is often used to justify persecution; many Global South activists embrace rights frameworks; human rights are meant to be universal. Evaluation: the tension is real and requires careful navigation. Best approach: support local activists and frameworks, avoid imposing Western categories, while recognising that persecution happens globally and people deserve protection. Universal principles can be expressed through diverse cultural forms."

          "sampleAnswer": "Framework principles: 1) Challenge systems, not just seek inclusion - question institutions, not just access to them. 2) Centre most marginalised - those at intersections of multiple oppressions guide priorities. 3) Coalition approach - link with other justice movements. 4) Question norms, not just exclusion - why are these norms privileged? 5) Redistribution and recognition - material resources alongside cultural recognition. 6) Prefigurative politics - create the world we want in our organising. 7) Decolonise - acknowledge Indigenous knowledge and ongoing colonisation. 8) Sustainability - long-term change, not just victories. Application: rather than just seeking marriage rights, advocate for recognising diverse relationships; rather than just inclusion in military, question militarism; rather than just representation, examine what's being represented. This doesn't mean rejecting reforms but ensuring they contribute to transformation."

Colonisation imposed Western binary systems through missions, boarding schools, and laws. Indigenous knowledge systems were suppressed and practices pathologised or criminalised. Western categories (homosexual, transgender) were introduced, sometimes displacing Indigenous concepts. Today, Indigenous LGBTQ+ people navigate between Western frameworks and traditional understandings. Reclaiming traditional identities (Two-Spirit, Sistergirl/Brotherboy) is part of decolonisation. Understanding this history shows that binary systems are not universal human nature but culturally specific impositions."

          "sampleAnswer": "Assimilationist politics (seeking acceptance through demonstrating similarity to heterosexual norms) succeeds because: it's politically strategic - meets people where they are, reduces fear of difference, builds majority coalitions. Essentialism supports it - 'born this way' arguments gained marriage equality. It achieves concrete gains - legal rights, protection, mainstream acceptance. It fails because: queer theory shows it reinforces rather than challenges oppressive norms - heteronormative institutions are joined, not transformed. Intersectionality reveals who's left behind - those who can't or won't assimilate (gender non-conforming, polyamorous, poor). Constructionism shows normalised categories are created, not discovered - 'good gays' vs 'bad queers.' Postcolonial analysis shows assimilation into Western norms ignores diverse possibilities. Minority stress continues even with legal equality because social stigma persists for those who don't fit respectable images. Synthesis: assimilationist and transformative approaches both have value; tension between them is productive if it leads to both achieving reforms AND questioning what we're reforming toward."
