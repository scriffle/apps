Adolescent brains are still developing in areas controlling impulse and long-term thinking, which can lead to underestimating risks or overweighting immediate rewards. Adolescents have less experience with consequences, so risks may seem more abstract. Peer influence is stronger, potentially affecting risk-taking. Adults may overestimate some risks based on media or anxiety. These differences have implications for safety strategies: for young people, abstract warnings may be less effective than concrete, relatable examples. Harm minimisation approaches that acknowledge risk-taking may be more effective than abstinence-only messages. Peer-led education can leverage social influence positively. Strategies that engage the reward-seeking tendency (making safe behaviour rewarding) may work better than fear-based approaches.

Sociological research emphasises social construction: how risks are defined, communicated, and managed through social processes. Ulrich Beck's 'risk society' theory suggests modern societies are increasingly organised around managing manufactured risks.

Climate change affecting safety, emerging technologies, and pandemics are examples. Traditional risk assessment struggles with these because: causes and effects are complex and interconnected; uncertainty is high; values differ about acceptable risk levels; and solutions have unintended consequences. Approaches for complex risks include: systems thinking that considers interconnections; adaptive management that adjusts as learning occurs; participatory processes involving diverse stakeholders; and resilience frameworks that focus on capacity to respond rather than prediction."

Who gets to decide what risks are acceptable? What is owed to future generations regarding long-term risks? How should uncertainty be handled when outcomes are potentially serious? Ethical principles relevant to risk include: proportionality (responses matching risk level); equity (fair distribution of risks and benefits); autonomy (respecting informed choice); precaution (erring on the side of caution for serious risks); and transparency (open communication about risks and uncertainties). These principles can conflict, requiring ethical reasoning to navigate difficult trade-offs."
