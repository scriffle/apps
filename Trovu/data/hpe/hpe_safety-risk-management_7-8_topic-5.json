Intervention research shows effectiveness of pool fencing, swim training in endemic areas, and rescue services, but implementation varies enormously. The WHO Global Report on Drowning has raised awareness, but resources follow burden unevenly - high-income countries invest heavily while most deaths occur in low-resource settings. Research challenges include underreporting, especially in developing countries, and difficulty measuring non-fatal incidents."

The relationship between UV exposure and cancer is complex - intense intermittent exposure (sunburn) may matter more than total dose for melanoma. Fair-skinned populations historically from low-UV regions (European ancestry) are at highest risk globally. Climate change may affect future UV patterns. Prevention research shows sun protection works, but implementation remains challenging. Tanning culture persists despite knowledge of risks. Economic analyses show prevention is cost-effective given treatment costs. Research frontiers include understanding genetic susceptibility and developing better early detection."

Bangladesh has reduced child drowning through community supervision programs. High-income countries often rely on infrastructure (pool fencing, patrolled beaches) that isn't feasible everywhere. Nordic countries have high UV awareness despite lower UV levels. Low and middle-income countries face different challenges - infrastructure cost, competing health priorities, and different water exposure patterns. Evaluating international approaches requires understanding context - what works depends on resources, culture, and exposure patterns."

Climate change brings flooding (different drowning patterns), changed UV (ozone recovery and climate effects), and population movement (people in unfamiliar environments). Ageing populations face higher drowning risk from medical events in water. Migration means more people learning to swim later in life in unfamiliar environments. Technology offers opportunities (apps, drones for rescue, UV sensors) but also risks (distraction). Mental health intersects with water (intentional self-harm is a proportion of drowning). Addressing emerging challenges requires research, adaptable programs, and willingness to innovate."
