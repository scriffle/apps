            "content": "Communication is how we share information, ideas, and feelings with others. It happens through words (what we say), tone of voice (how we say it), and body language (what our face and body show).\n\nSometimes these parts match—when you smile and say 'I'm happy,' your words and body language say the same thing. But sometimes they don't match—like when someone says 'I'm fine' but looks upset. People usually trust body language more than words.\n\nGood communication helps relationships work well. When people understand each other, they feel closer and have fewer problems. Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings."

            "content": "People have different ways of communicating. Passive communication is when you don't speak up about what you want or need. You might go along with others even when you don't want to. This can lead to feeling frustrated or taken advantage of.\n\nAggressive communication is when you speak up, but in a way that's pushy, loud, or hurtful. You might get what you want, but you hurt others in the process. This damages relationships.\n\nPassive-aggressive communication is when you're upset but don't say so directly. Instead, you might give the silent treatment, make sarcastic comments, or 'forget' to do things. This is confusing for others and doesn't solve problems.\n\nAssertive communication is the healthy middle ground. You express what you think and feel clearly and respectfully. You stand up for yourself while also respecting others. This is the style that works best for healthy relationships."

'I feel upset when my things are borrowed without asking' is better than 'You always take my stuff!' The first one shares your feelings; the second one sounds like an attack.\n\nBe specific about what you're asking for. Instead of 'Be nicer to me,' try 'I'd like you to knock before coming into my room.' The second one is clear and the other person knows exactly what you want.\n\nYou can be assertive while still being kind. You can disagree with someone, say no to something, or share negative feelings—all while being respectful. It's not about being mean; it's about being honest."

Show you're listening with nods or brief responses like 'mm-hm' or 'I see.'\n\nDon't interrupt or plan what you'll say next while the other person is talking. Focus on understanding them first. If you don't understand something, ask questions.\n\nReflect back what you've heard. You might say 'So you're saying...' or 'It sounds like you felt...'

If you feel yourself getting angry, take a breath. It's okay to say 'I need a minute' and come back when you're calmer. You'll make better decisions when you're not overwhelmed.\n\nFocus on the problem, not the person. Instead of attacking someone's character ('You're so selfish!'), talk about the specific issue ('I was upset when you didn't save me a seat').\n\nListen to understand, not just to reply. Try to see things from the other person's point of view. You don't have to agree, but understanding helps find solutions.\n\nLook for solutions, not winners. The goal isn't to 'win' the argument—it's to solve the problem. Ask 'How can we fix this?' rather than trying to prove you're right."

            "content": "Verbal communication includes the words we use, the questions we ask, and how we structure what we say. Choosing words carefully matters—the same message can come across very differently depending on word choice.\n\nNon-verbal communication includes body language (posture, gestures, eye contact), facial expressions, tone of voice, and physical distance. Research suggests non-verbal communication carries more weight than words—some studies suggest up to 90% of emotional meaning comes from non-verbal cues.\n\nCongruence means your verbal and non-verbal communication match. When someone says 'I'm not angry' through clenched teeth with crossed arms, there's incongruence. People generally trust non-verbal signals more when they conflict with words.\n\nCultural differences affect communication. Eye contact, physical proximity, gestures, and directness vary across cultures. What's respectful in one culture might be rude in another. Being aware of cultural differences helps communicate across backgrounds.\n\nDigital communication lacks most non-verbal cues, which is why misunderstandings are common in text messages and online. Emojis partially substitute for non-verbal signals, but much is still lost."

            "title": "Assertiveness in Practice",
            "content": "Assertiveness can be applied to many situations. Saying no involves declining requests you don't want to accept. You can be clear and kind: 'I can't come to the party, but thanks for inviting me.' You don't need to give long excuses or justify your decision.\n\nMaking requests assertively means asking for what you need clearly. 'Would you be able to help me with this after school?' is better than hinting and hoping someone offers.\n\nGiving feedback involves sharing your perspective on someone's behaviour. Using specific observations and 'I' statements helps: 'I noticed you've been on your phone a lot when we hang out. I feel like you're not interested in talking to me.'\n\nReceiving criticism assertively means listening without becoming defensive, considering if there's truth in it, and responding calmly. You might say, 'Thank you for telling me. I'll think about that.'\n\nStanding up for others is assertiveness in service of someone else. If you see someone being treated unfairly, speaking up (when safe to do so) is assertive action.\n\nKnowing when to be assertive matters too. Not every situation requires assertiveness—sometimes letting things go is wise. Judgment about what's worth addressing develops with practice."

            "content": "Resolving conflicts effectively often follows a process. First, define the problem clearly. What exactly is the issue? Sometimes what seems like one conflict is actually several issues tangled together. Get specific about what needs to be addressed.\n\nSecond, share perspectives. Each person explains their view without interruption. The goal is understanding, not agreement yet. Each person should feel heard before moving on.\n\nThird, identify underlying needs and feelings. Beyond the surface issue, what do people need? Often conflicts arise because needs for respect, fairness, inclusion, or security aren't being met. Getting to underlying needs opens up more solutions.\n\nFourth, generate possible solutions. Brainstorm options without evaluating them yet. Creative solutions sometimes emerge that satisfy everyone's needs in ways not initially obvious.\n\nFifth, evaluate and choose solutions. Assess which options address the needs identified. The best solutions are those where everyone feels satisfied, not where someone wins and someone loses.\n\nSixth, agree on next steps and follow up. Be specific about what will happen. Check back later to see if the solution is working."

            "title": "Managing Emotions in Conflict",
            "content": "Conflict triggers emotions that can help or hinder resolution. Recognising your emotional state is the first step. Physical signs like tense muscles, racing heart, or flushed face signal emotional activation. Name what you're feeling.\n\nWhen emotions are high, the thinking brain is less effective. Taking a pause before responding helps—this might be a deep breath, counting to ten, or saying 'I need a minute.' The goal is responding rather than reacting.\n\nSelf-regulation techniques include deep breathing, which activates the calming parasympathetic nervous system, physical movement (even briefly) to discharge tension, changing your body position (sitting down, uncrossing arms), and self-talk ('I can handle this calmly').\n\nKnowing your triggers helps you prepare. If you know certain topics or behaviours trigger strong reactions in you, you can anticipate and plan how to manage.\n\nIt's okay to take a break if emotions become too intense. Saying 'I'm too upset to have this conversation well right now. Can we come back to it in an hour?' is more productive than saying things you'll regret."

            "title": "Repair and Reconnection",
            "content": "After conflict, repairing the relationship is important. Apologies matter when you've caused harm. Effective apologies include acknowledging what you did, recognising its impact, expressing genuine remorse, and committing to different behaviour. 'I'm sorry I snapped at you. I know that hurt. I was stressed but that's not an excuse. I'll try to handle my stress differently next time.'\n\nForgiveness is releasing resentment after being harmed. It doesn't mean pretending something didn't happen or that it was okay. It means choosing not to hold onto anger. Forgiveness benefits the forgiver as well as the forgiven.\n\nRebuilding trust takes time. If trust was damaged, consistent behaviour over time is needed to rebuild it. Actions matter more than words—showing change through behaviour is more convincing than promising to change.\n\nReconnection rituals help restore closeness. This might be doing an activity together, having a conversation about positive things, or explicitly expressing care for the relationship.\n\nSome conflicts can't be fully resolved. When fundamental differences exist, the goal might be accepting the difference and managing it rather than resolving it. Agreeing to disagree respectfully is sometimes the best outcome."

Transactional model of communication views communication as a simultaneous, mutual process where all parties are both senders and receivers. Communication doesn't just go from one person to another—it's co-created.\n\nCoordinated management of meaning (CMM) theory examines how people create meaning together through communication. Meaning isn't fixed but is negotiated through interaction. The same words can mean different things in different relationships and contexts.\n\nCommunication accommodation theory examines how people adjust their communication to others. Convergence involves adapting to be more similar to the other person, while divergence involves emphasising differences. These adjustments signal solidarity or distance.\n\nSocial penetration theory describes how relationships develop through increasingly personal communication. Like peeling an onion, relationships deepen as people share more layers of themselves. Self-disclosure reciprocity—matching the depth of sharing—helps relationships progress.\n\nPoliteness theory examines how people manage 'face'—the social self-image we want to maintain. Positive face is the desire to be liked and approved of; negative face is the desire for autonomy and not being imposed upon. Effective communicators balance these needs."

            "content": "Thomas-Kilmann's conflict mode model identifies five approaches to conflict, varying on two dimensions: assertiveness (concern for own needs) and cooperativeness (concern for others' needs).\n\nCompeting is high assertiveness, low cooperativeness—pursuing your own goals at the expense of others. This might be appropriate for urgent decisions or protecting important interests, but damages relationships if overused.\n\nAccommodating is low assertiveness, high cooperativeness—giving in to others' wishes. This can preserve harmony and is appropriate when the issue matters more to the other person, but leads to resentment if habitual.\n\nAvoiding is low on both dimensions—withdrawing from conflict. Sometimes appropriate for trivial issues or when emotions are too high, but problems fester if avoided too long.\n\nCollaborating is high on both dimensions—working together to find solutions that fully satisfy everyone. This is often ideal but requires time, skill, and willing partners.\n\nCompromising is moderate on both—meeting in the middle. This is practical when full collaboration isn't possible, but may leave both parties partly unsatisfied.\n\nFlexibility in styles is key. Effective conflict managers adapt their approach to the situation rather than using only one style."

            "content": "Culture significantly affects communication. High-context cultures (common in Asia, Africa, Middle East) rely heavily on context, non-verbal cues, and shared understanding. Low-context cultures (common in Australia, US, Northern Europe) rely more on explicit verbal communication.\n\nCultural dimensions affecting communication include individualism vs. collectivism (focus on self vs. group), power distance (acceptance of hierarchy), uncertainty avoidance (tolerance for ambiguity), and long-term vs. short-term orientation.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, communication often involves circular rather than linear narrative styles, importance of silence and listening, relationship-focused communication, and protocols about who can speak on certain topics. Understanding these differences supports intercultural communication.\n\nContext affects communication beyond culture. Professional vs. personal contexts, online vs. face-to-face, public vs. private settings all shape what and how we communicate. Code-switching—adjusting communication style across contexts—is a valuable skill.\n\nIntercultural communication competence involves awareness of your own cultural patterns, knowledge of other cultural norms, skills in adapting communication, and respect for difference without stereotyping."

            "title": "Negotiation and Mediation",
            "content": "Negotiation is communication aimed at reaching agreement when parties have both shared and opposed interests. Position-based negotiation focuses on stated positions ('I want this'); interest-based negotiation explores underlying interests ('I need X because...'). Interest-based approaches typically yield better outcomes.\n\nPrincipled negotiation, developed by Fisher and Ury, involves separating people from the problem, focusing on interests not positions, generating options for mutual gain, and using objective criteria to evaluate options.\n\nMediation involves a neutral third party facilitating resolution. The mediator doesn't impose solutions but helps parties communicate, understand each other, and find their own resolution. Peer mediation programs in schools train students to mediate conflicts among classmates.\n\nMediator skills include creating a safe environment for dialogue, remaining neutral and not taking sides, active listening and reflecting, asking questions that deepen understanding, reality-testing proposed solutions, and helping parties reach agreement.\n\nRestorative practices go beyond resolving specific conflicts to repair harm and restore relationships. Restorative conversations and circles bring together those affected by harm to discuss impact and find ways to make things right."

It requires knowledge (knowing what to do), skill (ability to do it), and motivation (desire to communicate well).\n\nDeveloping competence involves practice and feedback. Communication is a skill that improves with deliberate practice. Seeking and accepting feedback helps identify areas for development.\n\nSelf-monitoring—observing your own communication and its effects—helps develop competence. Paying attention to how others respond provides information about what works.\n\nMetacommunication—communication about communication—helps relationships. Discussing how you communicate ('I notice we often argue about this. Can we talk about how to discuss it better?') can improve patterns.\n\nDeveloping a range of strategies provides flexibility. Rather than having one approach, competent communicators have multiple strategies and choose among them based on the situation.\n\nEmotional intelligence supports communication competence. Recognising and managing your own emotions, and being attuned to others' emotions, helps navigate the emotional dimensions of communication."

Relationships navigate these ongoing tensions through various strategies.\n\nCommunication privacy management theory examines how people manage boundaries around personal information. People develop rules about what to share, with whom, and how. Boundary turbulence occurs when these rules are violated.\n\nMultiple goals theory recognises that communication typically serves multiple, sometimes competing goals simultaneously—task goals (getting things done), relational goals (maintaining relationships), and identity goals (presenting oneself favourably). Skilled communicators navigate multiple goals effectively.\n\nCommunicative constitution of organisations (CCO) theory views organisations as constituted through communication—they don't just use communication, they are created and maintained through it. This perspective highlights how everyday interactions build organisational reality.\n\nComputationally mediated communication research examines how digital platforms shape communication. Algorithmic curation, platform design, and technological affordances all influence what and how people communicate."

            "content": "Conflict occurs within systems—families, schools, communities—and systemic approaches address patterns beyond individual disputes. Conflict systems theory examines how conflicts develop, escalate, and can be transformed. Conflicts have their own dynamics that can perpetuate regardless of the specific people involved.\n\nEscalation and de-escalation dynamics reveal how conflicts intensify or calm. Tit-for-tat retaliation, generalisation from specific issues to character attacks, and bringing in additional parties can escalate conflicts. De-escalation involves breaking these patterns through gestures of reconciliation, focusing on interests, and building trust.\n\nStructural conflict arises from how systems are organised—unequal resources, incompatible roles, or problematic procedures. Resolving structural conflict requires changing systems, not just addressing specific disputes. This connects to social justice approaches that see many conflicts as rooted in inequality.\n\nConflict transformation (Lederach) goes beyond resolution to examine how conflict can transform relationships and social structures. Rather than just ending conflict, transformation builds more just and sustainable peace.\n\nIntergenerational and historical conflict involves patterns passed across generations. Unresolved historical injustices, such as colonisation, continue to affect contemporary relationships. Addressing such conflict requires acknowledgment, truth-telling, and systemic change."

What can be said, who can speak, and what counts as knowledge are shaped by power.\n\nCommunication and social identity relates to how group memberships affect communication. Communication accommodation theory examines how people adjust to each other; social identity theory examines how group membership affects perception and interaction.\n\nSilencing and voice concern whose voices are heard and whose are marginalised. Practices of silencing include interruption, dismissal, and exclusion from spaces of communication. Creating space for marginalised voices requires intentional effort.\n\nIntersectionality in communication examines how multiple identities interact. A person's gender, race, class, disability, and sexuality all affect their communication experiences, and these dimensions interact in complex ways.\n\nCritical communication studies examines how communication practices serve dominant interests and how they might be transformed. This includes analysis of media, organisations, and everyday interaction."

Difficult conversations (Stone, Patton, Heen) involve three layers: the 'what happened' conversation (facts and interpretations), the feelings conversation (emotions involved), and the identity conversation (what the situation means for self-concept).\n\nNavigating difficult conversations involves moving from certainty to curiosity, acknowledging feelings without being controlled by them, disentangling intent from impact, and moving from blame to contribution.\n\nConversations about values and identity are particularly challenging because they touch on core aspects of who we are. When values conflict, finding shared ground or agreeing to respectful disagreement may be the best achievable outcome.\n\nConversations about harm and wrongdoing require balancing accountability with compassion. Effective approaches focus on specific behaviours and their impact, allow for explanation without excusing, and look toward repair and changed behaviour.\n\nCross-cultural difficult conversations add layers of complexity. Different cultural norms about directness, face-saving, and appropriate topics require careful navigation. Cultural humility—recognising the limits of one's own cultural perspective—is essential."

Are we measuring knowledge, attitudes, skills, or behaviours? What comparison groups are appropriate? How do we capture contextual factors?\n\nAction research involves practitioners studying their own practice. This is relevant for teachers, counsellors, and others who want to improve their communication work through systematic reflection.\n\nParticipatory approaches involve those affected in research design and interpretation. This is particularly important for research with marginalised communities, where researcher perspectives may not align with community experiences.\n\nTranslating research into practice involves adapting findings to specific contexts. What works in one setting may need modification for another. Continuous improvement involves ongoing evaluation and adjustment."

A facilitator met with each person to explain the process and ensure readiness to participate.\n\nIn the restorative conference, participants sat in a circle. Those harmed spoke about the impact on them. Those who caused harm heard directly how their actions affected others. Community members shared how the incident affected the school community.\n\nRather than the school imposing punishment, the group worked together to develop agreements about repair. Those who caused harm agreed to specific actions to address the harm they'd caused, including apologising directly, doing service for the school, and completing education about digital citizenship.\n\nThe process took more time than a standard disciplinary response, but outcomes included greater satisfaction among those harmed, better understanding by those who caused harm of their impact, lower rates of repeat offending, and strengthened community norms against cyberbullying.\n\nThis case illustrates conflict transformation—using conflict as an opportunity to build stronger relationships and clearer norms.",

            "content": "Critical communication studies examines how communication practices reproduce or challenge power relations. Drawing on critical theory traditions, this approach reveals how 'common sense' communication norms serve particular interests.\n\nPoststructural approaches, influenced by Derrida and others, examine how meaning is constructed through language and how communication categories (like 'healthy communication') are not natural but constructed. Deconstruction reveals the assumptions and exclusions in communication concepts.\n\nFoucauldian analysis examines discourse—systems of language and practice that constitute knowledge and power. Discourses around 'good communication' or 'healthy relationships' produce particular kinds of subjects and exclude alternatives. Genealogy traces how current discursive practices emerged historically.\n\nCommunicative capitalism (Jodi Dean) examines how digital communication is captured by capitalist logics. Participation in digital communication that seems democratic actually generates data and attention for platform owners. Critical analysis asks who benefits from contemporary communication arrangements.\n\nFeminist communication scholarship examines gender in communication. This includes examining gendered communication styles, how communication reinforces or challenges gender inequality, and how feminist practices might transform communication."

            "content": "Communication is central to social change. Social movements use communication to mobilise, coordinate, and advocate. Digital communication has transformed movement possibilities, enabling rapid coordination while also creating vulnerabilities to surveillance and manipulation.\n\nDialogic communication (Freire) emphasises communication as mutual, transformative dialogue rather than one-way transmission. Dialogue involves listening, respect, and openness to being changed by the encounter. Consciousness-raising through dialogue supports liberatory change.\n\nDeliberative democracy theories emphasise communication in public decision-making. Habermas's ideal speech situation describes conditions for genuine deliberation: equal participation, freedom from coercion, and orientation to reaching understanding. Real deliberation rarely meets these ideals but they provide criteria for evaluation.\n\nNonviolent communication (Rosenberg) offers a practice model emphasising observation without evaluation, identifying feelings and needs, and making requests. This approach aims to connect people and address needs without domination. It has been used in conflict resolution, mediation, and personal relationships.\n\nDecolonising communication involves challenging Eurocentric dominance in communication theory and practice. This includes centring Indigenous and non-Western communication traditions, examining how colonial communication patterns persist, and developing more just communication arrangements."

The social scientific paradigm (post-positivist) seeks to explain and predict communication through systematic observation. It values objectivity, generalisability, and quantitative methods. Contributions include identifying communication patterns and testing interventions.\n\nThe interpretive paradigm seeks to understand communication from participants' perspectives. It values depth, context, and qualitative methods. Contributions include rich description of communication practices and revelation of meaning-making processes.\n\nThe critical paradigm examines communication in relation to power and social justice. It values praxis—the integration of theory and action for change. Contributions include exposing how communication serves dominant interests and envisioning alternatives.\n\nThe rhetorical tradition examines persuasion and public discourse. It analyses how texts and performances function rhetorically and offers principles for effective advocacy.\n\nInterdisciplinary and integrative approaches draw on multiple paradigms. Communication studies as a field is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on sociology, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and other disciplines."

Globalisation has intensified intercultural communication, creating both possibilities and challenges. Power imbalances shape whose communication practices become global norms.\n\nPostcolonial communication perspectives examine how colonialism shaped global communication patterns and how colonial legacies persist. Western communication models dominate globally, marginalising indigenous and non-Western approaches.\n\nPeace and conflict studies examine communication in contexts of violent conflict and peacebuilding. Track II diplomacy involves unofficial dialogue processes complementing formal negotiations. Transformative mediation and dialogue processes aim to shift relationships, not just settle disputes.\n\nTruth and reconciliation processes use communication to address historical injustices. Australia's Stolen Generations inquiries and ongoing reconciliation processes involve bearing witness to harm, acknowledging truth, and building new relationships. Communication is central to these processes.\n\nGlobal civil society communication involves transnational advocacy networks, NGOs, and social movements communicating across borders. Digital technologies enable global coordination but also raise questions about representation, accountability, and whose voices are centred."

Young activists developed communication strategies including compelling visual content, clear demands, and narratives centring youth perspectives.\n\nCritical analysis reveals complexities. Platform algorithms shaped which messages spread. Digital divides meant some young people participated more than others. The movement faced challenges translating digital engagement into policy change. Critics questioned whether student strikes were effective advocacy or disruptive distraction.\n\nThe movement also prompted adult responses—some supportive, some dismissive.
