It also includes things you can choose, like your interests, friends, and how you behave.\n\nSome parts of identity come from our families and culture. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples understand identity as deeply connected to Country, family, and community. Your mob, your Country, and your Dreaming stories are all part of who you are. For many Australians, culture plays a big role in shaping identity.\n\nAs you grow into a teenager and young adult, you start to think more about who you are and who you want to be. This is normal and healthy. You might try new things, change your style, or develop new interests. This is all part of figuring out your identity.\n\nPersonal agency is your power to make choices. Even when life is hard, you can choose how you respond. You can choose to work hard at school. You can choose to be kind to others. You can choose to look after your health. These choices help shape who you become.\n\nHaving personal agency does not mean you control everything. Some things in life are not fair, and some people have more opportunities than others. But even in difficult situations, you can still make choices about your attitude and actions."

His uncle explains that family is important, but so is finding your own path. He says that being true to yourself does not mean turning your back on your family.\n\nMarcus decides to keep helping on the farm while also joining the school band and taking music classes. He talks honestly with his parents about his interests.

        "conceptExplanation": "Identity is the answer to the question 'Who am I?' It includes many different aspects of who you are. Some parts of identity are given to us at birth - our family, our cultural background, our physical characteristics. Other parts develop through our experiences - the places we have lived, the people we have known, the things that have happened to us. And some parts we actively choose - our interests, our values, how we treat others.\n\nDuring adolescence, identity development becomes particularly important. Psychologist Erik Erikson described this as a time when young people work on forming their own identity separate from their parents. This does not mean rejecting your family, but it does mean thinking for yourself about what you believe and value.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, identity is deeply connected to Country, kinship, and community. Identity is not just about the individual but about relationships and responsibilities to others and to the land. This collective view of identity is different from more individualistic Western perspectives, but both offer valuable insights.\n\nPersonal agency is your power to shape your own life. It includes being able to make choices, set goals, and take action. While there are always factors outside our control (like where we were born or unexpected events), personal agency means focusing on what we can influence.\n\nDeveloping personal agency involves several skills: knowing yourself (your strengths, values, and goals), thinking through options, making decisions, and taking responsibility for your choices. It also means recognising that sometimes the most important choice is how we respond to things we cannot control."

She wondered if something was wrong with her. But in her Health class, she learned about bicultural identity - having a foot in two cultures.\n\nPriya started to see her dual cultural background as a strength rather than a problem. She could understand different perspectives, speak multiple languages, and move between cultural contexts. She decided to embrace both parts of her heritage rather than feeling she had to choose one.\n\nShe also realised she had personal agency in how she expressed her identity.

        "conceptExplanation": "Identity formation is a core developmental task of adolescence. Psychologist Erik Erikson identified this period as crucial for developing a coherent sense of self. According to Erikson, young people who successfully navigate this stage emerge with a clear identity, while those who struggle may experience 'role confusion' - uncertainty about who they are and their place in the world.\n\nContemporary understanding recognises that identity is not a single thing but a complex integration of multiple aspects. These include your personal identity (individual characteristics, values, and goals), social identity (group memberships and relationships), and cultural identity (connection to cultural heritage and traditions). Intersectionality recognises that these aspects interact - your experience is shaped by the unique combination of your various identities.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, identity is fundamentally relational and connected to Country. Identity emerges from kinship networks, connection to ancestral lands, and participation in cultural practices. This perspective challenges Western individualistic notions of identity and offers an alternative understanding where self is inseparable from community and place.\n\nIdentity development involves two key processes: exploration and commitment. Exploration means actively investigating different possibilities - trying on different roles, questioning inherited beliefs, and considering various futures. Commitment means choosing to invest in particular values, beliefs, relationships, or directions. Healthy identity development involves both exploring options and making meaningful commitments.\n\nPersonal agency is central to authentic identity formation. Agency means having the capacity to act independently, make choices, and influence your own life. However, agency always operates within constraints. Structural factors (socioeconomic status, discrimination, access to opportunities) can limit agency, while resources (education, support networks, skills) can enhance it. Developing agency involves recognising both your power to shape your life and the real constraints you face.\n\nAuthentic identity development requires distinguishing between external pressures and genuine internal values. Social media, peer pressure, and cultural messages all influence how we present ourselves. Developing authenticity involves critical reflection on these influences and the courage to align your identity with your true values, even when this differs from external expectations."

They have always felt uncomfortable with strict gender expectations but did not have the language to understand their experience until recently. After researching online and connecting with LGBTQ+ communities, Jordan has begun identifying as non-binary and prefers they/them pronouns.\n\nJordan faces a complex situation. They feel confident about their identity but are unsure about how to communicate this with their family, who hold traditional views. They have supportive friends and access to a school counsellor who affirms diverse identities.\n\nJordan decides to take a gradual approach. They start by asking close friends to use they/them pronouns, then gradually include other peers. They prepare to have a conversation with their parents, researching resources that might help explain non-binary identity.

        "conceptExplanation": "Erik Erikson's psychosocial development theory positions identity versus role confusion as the fifth of eight developmental crises spanning the lifespan. Erikson argued that adolescents must synthesise childhood identifications with emerging self-understandings to form a coherent adult identity. Successful resolution produces fidelity - the ability to maintain commitments despite inevitable contradictions. Erikson also introduced the concept of psychosocial moratorium - a period of exploration where society permits young people to experiment before committing to adult roles.\n\nJames Marcia operationalised Erikson's theory through his identity status paradigm. Marcia proposed that identity formation could be assessed through two dimensions: exploration (active questioning and investigation) and commitment (firm investment in particular values, beliefs, or directions). These dimensions produce four statuses:\n\n- Identity diffusion: Low exploration, low commitment. Individuals have not engaged with identity questions and lack clear direction.\n- Identity foreclosure: Low exploration, high commitment. Individuals have committed to an identity without exploring alternatives, typically adopting family or cultural expectations without question.\n- Identity moratorium: High exploration, low commitment. Individuals are actively exploring possibilities but have not yet made firm commitments.\n- Identity achievement: High exploration, high commitment. Individuals have explored alternatives and made meaningful commitments based on that exploration.\n\nResearch suggests these statuses are not fixed stages but can fluctuate, and the process of identity development continues throughout life.\n\nContemporary scholarship has critiqued classical theories for underemphasising the role of power and social structure. Intersectionality, developed by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, highlights how multiple identity dimensions interact. A young person is not simply 'female' or 'Indigenous' or 'working class' - they may be all these simultaneously, and the combination creates a unique positionality that cannot be reduced to any single dimension.\n\nThe structure-agency debate addresses how much individuals can shape their identities given structural constraints. Structures include socioeconomic conditions, institutional discrimination, cultural norms, and access to resources. These structures both constrain identity possibilities (certain identities are more available or acceptable in certain contexts) and enable them (resources and recognition support identity development). Agency involves the capacity to act within, against, or around these structures.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives contribute important critiques of Western individualistic identity theories. In many Indigenous frameworks, identity is fundamentally relational - emerging from kinship networks, connection to Country, and cultural continuity rather than individual achievement. These perspectives challenge the assumption that identity is primarily an individual project and highlight collective dimensions of selfhood."

        ],
        "conceptExplanation": "Classical developmental psychology, exemplified by Erikson and Marcia, positioned identity formation as a universal human process culminating in achieved identity - a coherent, stable sense of self. This framework has been enormously influential but rests on several assumptions that critical scholars have questioned.\n\nFirst, developmental frameworks assume universality - that identity development follows similar patterns across cultures. Cross-cultural research has complicated this assumption, revealing that Western emphases on individual uniqueness and self-determination are not universal but culturally specific. In many cultures, identity is fundamentally about social roles and relationships rather than individual distinctiveness.\n\nSecond, developmental frameworks tend toward teleological assumptions - that development moves toward a normative endpoint (achieved identity). This can pathologise those who do not fit the expected pattern and ignores how the 'endpoint' itself reflects particular cultural values.\n\nPost-structural theorists, drawing on thinkers like Michel Foucault and Judith Butler, offer more radical critiques. Rather than seeing identity as something to be achieved, they conceptualise subjectivity as produced through discourse - systems of knowledge and practice that shape what can be thought and said. In this view, there is no pre-existing essential self to discover; rather, we become subjects through discursive processes that simultaneously enable and constrain our possibilities.\n\nButler's work on gender identity exemplifies this approach. Rather than seeing gender as an inner essence expressed outwardly, Butler argues that gender is performatively constituted - we become gendered through repeated performances that create the appearance of a stable inner identity. This does not mean gender is freely chosen; rather, we perform within constraints that make certain performances more possible than others.\n\nIndigenous scholars contribute distinct ontological challenges. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander scholars have articulated relational ontologies where selfhood is fundamentally constituted through connections - to Country, kinship networks, and ancestral beings. This is not merely a different cultural emphasis but a different ontological position about what exists and how. Western individualism assumes separate selves who subsequently enter relationships; relational ontologies understand relationship as constitutive of being itself.\n\nThese theoretical debates have practical implications for understanding agency and authenticity. If identity is discursively produced, what does authentic agency mean? Post-structural perspectives suggest agency involves not escaping discourse (which is impossible) but strategic navigation within it - finding spaces for resistance, reimagining possibilities, and potentially transforming discursive constraints. Gayatri Spivak's concept of strategic essentialism suggests that while recognising identity categories as constructed, they can be strategically invoked for political purposes.\n\nEngaging with these perspectives does not require abandoning all notions of self or agency, but it does require holding them more tentatively - recognising them as particular frameworks rather than universal truths, and remaining open to alternative ways of understanding selfhood and agency."

The campaign for constitutional recognition involves asserting Indigenous identity - emphasising distinctiveness, continuity, and collective rights. From a post-structural perspective, this involves strategic essentialism: invoking identity categories that could be deconstructed in order to achieve political goals.\n\nYet this creates tensions. Recognition frameworks can fix identity in ways that constrain fluidity and complexity. They can create boundaries between who is and is not authentically Indigenous. They can privilege certain expressions of Indigeneity over others. Some scholars argue that seeking recognition from the settler state reinforces rather than challenges colonial structures.\n\nAlternatively, Indigenous sovereignty movements reject the recognition framework entirely, asserting that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples never ceded sovereignty and do not need recognition from a colonial state. This position rests on a different ontological foundation - understanding Indigenous peoples not as a minority group seeking inclusion but as sovereign nations with inherent rights.\n\nBoth positions involve strategic choices about how to assert Indigenous identity in the context of ongoing colonialism. Neither is simply 'right' or 'wrong' - they represent different political strategies with different theoretical underpinnings and different implications.\n\nThis example illustrates how identity politics involves navigating tensions between essentialism and constructionism, between recognition and sovereignty, and between strategic invocation of identity categories and awareness of their limitations.",

For wellbeing, it would recognise that human flourishing cannot be separated from the flourishing of communities and ecosystems. This is not simply adding a 'collectivist perspective' to Western individualism but proposing a different ontological foundation - that relationship is not something added to already-existing individuals but is constitutive of being itself.
