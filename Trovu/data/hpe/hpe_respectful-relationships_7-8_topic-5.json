Key principles include: design dignity (treating users with respect), user empowerment (giving users control over their experience), risk assessment (proactively identifying potential harms), and continuous improvement (updating based on emerging harms). This contrasts with reactive approaches that wait for harm to occur before responding. Implementing safety by design requires platforms to prioritise safety alongside engagement and profit, which may require regulatory incentives. Critics note that even well-designed platforms exist within broader social contexts that generate harm."

Potential directions include: AI-assisted harm detection with human oversight; restorative justice approaches that focus on accountability and repair rather than just punishment; education integrated throughout schooling; economic models that don't incentivise engagement at any cost; youth participation in platform governance; and addressing offline inequalities that drive online harm. Effective solutions likely combine technological, social, educational, and regulatory elements. Critical evaluation of proposed solutions should consider effectiveness, unintended consequences, equity implications, and human rights compatibility."
