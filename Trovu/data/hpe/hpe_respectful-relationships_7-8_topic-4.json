Intersectionality ensures our approach centres those most affected and addresses multiple forms of inequality. Prevention research shows that comprehensive, multi-level, sustained approaches work best - individual attitude change isn't sufficient without community and structural change. Strategic thinking helps navigate challenges: building coalitions across difference, responding to backlash, avoiding co-optation. Practically: young people can perform gender differently in their own lives; build peer cultures that value diversity; be active bystanders; push for institutional change; connect to broader movements.
