Your muscles might get tight. You might feel butterflies in your tummy. These changes happen because your body is getting ready to handle the challenge.\n\nSome stress is actually helpful. If you feel a little nervous before a sports game, it can help you play better because you are more alert. This kind of helpful stress is called eustress. But when stress lasts too long or feels too big, it can make you feel unwell. This is called distress.\n\nMany things can cause stress. For young people, stress might come from school work, friendship problems, changes at home, or trying new things. Everyone has different things that stress them out - what stresses one person might not stress another.\n\nThe good news is that you can learn ways to manage stress. Taking deep breaths can help your body calm down. Talking to someone you trust can help. Doing things you enjoy, like playing, drawing, or listening to music, can also help. When you know how to handle stress, you feel more in control."

        "conceptExplanation": "Stress is your body's natural response to challenges or changes. When you face something difficult, your brain sends signals that activate your stress response. This causes physical changes like faster heart rate, quicker breathing, and tense muscles. These changes are designed to help you deal with the challenge.\n\nThere are two types of stress. Eustress is positive stress - like the nervous excitement before a sports game or performance that helps you do your best. Distress is negative stress - like feeling overwhelmed by too much homework or ongoing friendship problems. Eustress usually feels manageable and temporary, while distress feels overwhelming and can last a long time.\n\nTeenagers face many potential stressors. School pressures like tests, assignments, and keeping up with work are common. Social stressors include friendship issues, peer pressure, and worrying about fitting in. Family changes, like parents separating or moving house, can be stressful. The changes happening in your body and emotions during puberty can also add stress.\n\nStress affects you in different ways. Physically, you might get headaches, stomach aches, or have trouble sleeping. Emotionally, you might feel anxious, irritable, or sad. Mentally, you might have trouble concentrating, make more mistakes, or forget things easily.\n\nThe good news is that there are many ways to manage stress. Physical activity helps release tension and produces feel-good chemicals in your brain. Relaxation techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness calm your body's stress response. Talking to someone you trust can help you feel less alone and get useful advice. Time management - breaking tasks into smaller steps and planning ahead - can reduce feeling overwhelmed. Finding the strategies that work best for you is key to managing stress."

She also feels like she is letting down her netball team because she missed training twice this month to do homework.\n\nMia's best friend Lily asks if something is wrong because Mia seems different. Mia says she is fine and just tired. But later that night, Mia lies awake thinking about everything and feels like crying.\n\nThe next day, Mia decides to talk to the school counsellor.

        ],
        "conceptExplanation": "When you perceive a threat or challenge, your brain triggers the stress response, also known as the fight-or-flight response. The part of your brain called the hypothalamus sends signals to release stress hormones including adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones cause immediate changes: your heart beats faster, breathing quickens, muscles tense, and senses sharpen. This response evolved to help our ancestors survive physical dangers like predators.\n\nIn modern life, the stress response can be triggered by everyday situations like exams, social pressures, or family conflicts. In short bursts, this response is helpful - it can help you focus during tests or perform in sports. This is eustress, or positive stress. However, when stressors are ongoing, your body stays in stress mode for too long. This chronic stress, or distress, can lead to health problems.\n\nAdolescence is a particularly challenging time. Your brain is still developing, especially the prefrontal cortex that helps regulate emotions. You are navigating significant changes: physical changes during puberty, forming your identity, managing more complex social relationships, and facing increasing academic demands. You might also experience pressures from social media, family issues, or uncertainty about the future.\n\nChronic stress affects multiple body systems. It can weaken your immune system, making you more likely to get sick. It can cause digestive problems, headaches, and muscle tension. It affects sleep quality. Emotionally, it can lead to anxiety, irritability, or depression. Mentally, it impairs concentration and memory.\n\nEffective stress management uses both problem-focused and emotion-focused approaches. Problem-focused strategies address the source of stress directly - like creating a study schedule to manage academic workload. Emotion-focused strategies help you manage your feelings about the stressor - like using deep breathing to calm anxiety. Physical activity, relaxation techniques, social support, and mindfulness are all proven strategies.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long understood the importance of connection for wellbeing. Connection to Country, family, community, and culture provides a sense of belonging and purpose that helps manage life's challenges. These holistic approaches recognise that wellbeing involves more than just managing individual symptoms."

During breaks, Jordan spends time scrolling social media, comparing achievements to classmates, which makes Jordan feel worse.\n\nDespite working harder than ever, Jordan's grades are slipping. Arguments with parents about screen time have increased. Jordan feels exhausted but cannot seem to relax even when there is free time.\n\nAfter a particularly bad week, Jordan talks to a trusted teacher who suggests some changes: prioritising the most important commitments, limiting social media before bed, trying some relaxation techniques, and being kinder to themselves about not being perfect at everything.",

          }
        ],
        "conceptExplanation": "The stress response is orchestrated by the HPA axis - a complex communication system between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands. When you perceive a threat, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), signalling the pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH prompts the adrenal glands to release cortisol and adrenaline. This system is designed to activate quickly and return to baseline once the threat passes.\n\nHowever, chronic activation leads to allostatic load - cumulative wear on the body. This manifests as cardiovascular problems, immune dysfunction, mental health issues, and cognitive impairment. The adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable because the prefrontal cortex, responsible for emotional regulation and rational decision-making, is not fully developed until the mid-twenties. This means adolescents may experience more intense emotional responses and have less developed coping mechanisms.\n\nContemporary adolescents face stressors that previous generations did not. Constant social comparison via social media, academic pressure in competitive economies, awareness of global issues like climate change, and the blurring of boundaries between school and home through digital technology all contribute to stress. These are often systemic stressors - arising from broader social conditions rather than individual circumstances.\n\nEffective stress management addresses multiple levels. At the individual level, strategies include relaxation techniques, cognitive reframing, and time management. At the relational level, social support and communication skills matter. At the systemic level, school policies, digital wellness practices, and community support play roles. Research shows that protective factors - social connection, physical activity, adequate sleep, and sense of purpose - can buffer against stress effects.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives emphasise connection to Country, culture, family, and community as fundamental to wellbeing. This holistic approach addresses stress at its roots by ensuring people feel they belong and have a place in the world. These perspectives challenge Western individualistic approaches to stress management by recognising that wellbeing is inherently relational."

        "conceptExplanation": "Contemporary stress research has moved beyond simplistic models to embrace biopsychosocial complexity. We now understand that stress experiences are mediated by genetic factors, early life experiences, current social context, and cultural meaning-making. Epigenetic research reveals that stress can alter gene expression, potentially affecting not only the individual but subsequent generations - a finding with profound implications for understanding intergenerational trauma in communities that have experienced systematic oppression.\n\nThe concept of 'toxic stress,' developed by the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard, distinguishes between positive stress (brief and growth-promoting), tolerable stress (more severe but buffered by supportive relationships), and toxic stress (prolonged and unbuffered), which can permanently alter brain architecture. This framework illuminates why some young people develop resilience while others struggle.\n\nCritical scholars challenge the focus on individual resilience. They argue that high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in young people should be understood not as individual pathology but as rational responses to pathological social conditions - including precarious economies, climate crisis, and the extractive attention economy of digital platforms. From this perspective, teaching stress management without addressing structural factors risks normalising unacceptable conditions.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives offer alternative frameworks, emphasising that wellbeing cannot be separated from connection to Country, culture, and community. These holistic approaches understand health as collective rather than individual, challenging Western biomedical models that locate problems within individuals. Connection to family, community, culture, and land provides meaning, belonging, and purpose that buffer against stress.\n\nEffective stress management must therefore navigate multiple levels: building individual skills, strengthening protective relationships, and advocating for systemic change. It must be culturally responsive, recognising that definitions of stress, appropriate coping, and wellbeing itself are culturally situated. Neither purely individual nor purely systemic approaches alone are sufficient - both are necessary."

Critics argue this 'pathologises' an appropriate response to a genuine threat and deflects attention from systemic action needed to address the underlying cause.\n\nYouth climate activists argue that channelling anxiety into collective action is the only rational response.

From neurobiology: stress responses are biological realities with physical effects; developmental sensitivity means adolescence is a critical window; supportive relationships buffer biological stress effects. From critical theory: high stress levels may reflect pathological social conditions not individual deficit; individualising stress obscures systemic causes; solutions must address structural factors. From Indigenous knowledge: wellbeing is collective not individual; connection to community, culture, and Country is foundational; health cannot be separated from social and environmental context. Synthesis: A 'Collective Stress Framework' would understand stress as arising from disrupted connections - biological dysregulation reflects relational and environmental disruption. Interventions would prioritise restoring connection at multiple levels while building individual capacity. Systemic advocacy would be understood as essential to wellbeing, not separate from it. Evaluation would consider collective wellbeing indicators alongside individual symptoms. This framework avoids both pure individual pathology and paralysing structural critique, enabling action at multiple levels simultaneously.",
