While this theory has been influential, it has also been criticised for cultural bias and overemphasis on justice at the expense of care.\n\nCarol Gilligan challenged Kohlberg's framework by proposing an 'ethic of care' that emphasises relationships, responsibility, and contextual understanding. She argued that this perspective, often associated with women's moral reasoning, was undervalued in traditional ethics.\n\nContemporary understanding recognises that moral development is complex, influenced by cognitive development, emotional growth, social experiences, and cultural context.

The major traditions - consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics - represent different responses to this fundamental question, each with sophisticated theoretical foundations.\n\nConsequentialist theories, including utilitarianism developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, ground ethics in outcomes. Act utilitarianism evaluates each action by its consequences, while rule utilitarianism evaluates rules that generally produce good outcomes. Critics argue that consequentialism can justify injustice if it produces good outcomes, struggles with measuring and comparing welfare, and fails to respect individual rights.\n\nKantian deontology, developed by Immanuel Kant, grounds ethics in reason and duty. The categorical imperative - 'Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law' - provides a rational test for moral rules. Critics argue that Kant's framework is too rigid, generates conflicting duties, and fails to account for the role of emotion in moral life.\n\nAristotelian virtue ethics grounds ethics in human flourishing (eudaimonia) and the cultivation of excellent character traits. Contemporary virtue ethicists like Alasdair MacIntyre have revived this tradition while addressing its challenges. Critics question whose conception of flourishing counts and how virtue ethics handles moral dilemmas.\n\nMeta-ethics examines the foundations of ethical claims themselves - whether moral facts exist, what moral language means, and how we can know moral truths.

While his conclusions are controversial, his method of interrogating the genealogy of moral values - asking who benefits from particular moral norms - remains influential.\n\nMichel Foucault extended this analysis, examining how moral discourse functions as a form of power that regulates behaviour and constitutes subjects. From this perspective, what counts as 'ethical' is not a timeless truth but a product of historical power relations. Foucault's later work explored 'ethics of the self' - the possibility of self-fashioning that resists normalising power.\n\nPostmodern ethics, influenced by thinkers like Jean-François Lyotard and Zygmunt Bauman, questions the possibility of universal moral foundations. Lyotard's concept of the 'differend' - a conflict between incommensurable perspectives where no meta-rule can adjudicate - challenges the assumption that ethical disputes can be rationally resolved.\n\nThese perspectives don't necessarily lead to moral nihilism. Emmanuel Levinas proposed an ethics grounded in the encounter with the 'Other' - an irreducible responsibility that precedes rational principles.

These assumptions are not neutral but reflect European cultural perspectives shaped by specific historical conditions.\n\nIndigenous ethical frameworks offer alternative foundations. Aboriginal Australian ethics, for example, is grounded in reciprocal relationships with Country, kinship responsibilities, and what Tyson Yunkaporta describes as 'pattern thinking' that emphasises connections rather than categories. These frameworks challenge the individualised, anthropocentric assumptions of mainstream Western ethics.\n\nDecolonising ethics involves not simply adding Indigenous perspectives to existing frameworks but questioning the frameworks themselves. This includes examining how colonialism continues to shape moral discourse, whose knowledge counts as 'philosophical,' and how power structures determine which ethical traditions are taken seriously.\n\nThis doesn't mean abandoning ethical judgment or relativising all claims. Rather, it involves developing more humble, dialogical approaches that recognise the limits of any single tradition and remain open to learning from diverse sources of ethical wisdom.",

This is not about rejecting these influences but understanding them and evaluating which to affirm and which to question.\n\nEngagement with diverse traditions expands your ethical resources beyond familiar frameworks. This includes not only Western philosophical traditions but Indigenous perspectives, Asian ethical traditions, feminist ethics, and other approaches that may offer insights unavailable in dominant discourses.\n\nIntegration and coherence involves developing a framework that holds together across contexts, while remaining flexible enough to accommodate complexity and uncertainty. This requires identifying your core commitments while acknowledging their limitations and remaining open to revision.\n\nPractice and habituation recognises that ethical development is not merely intellectual. Virtue ethics emphasises that moral character is cultivated through practice. Your ethical philosophy must be liveable - embodied in dispositions and actions, not just articulated in principles.\n\nDialogical development recognises that ethical wisdom develops through engagement with others. Being open to challenge, learning from disagreement, and participating in communities of ethical reflection all contribute to moral growth.\n\nA sophisticated ethical philosophy recognises its own provisionality - it is a framework for living and deciding that remains open to development as you encounter new experiences and perspectives.",

Unlike sovereign power that operates through laws and punishment, normalising power works through surveillance, comparison, and internalised standards. For ethics, this implies that what we consider 'moral' is not simply discovered through reason but is produced by historical power relations. Ethical norms define normal subjectivity and marginalise those who don't conform. This doesn't eliminate ethics but suggests we should question whose interests are served by particular moral frameworks and how ethics might enable rather than constrain human flourishing."

Might support generous intake if benefits outweigh costs, or restrictive policies if analysis suggests net negative outcomes. Treats persons as units of welfare to be aggregated. Levinasian approach: Begins with the face-to-face encounter with the vulnerable Other who makes an ethical demand. Before any calculation, the refugee's face calls me to responsibility that I cannot evade or outsource. This responsibility is infinite and prior to any rights-based framework. The approaches diverge fundamentally: utilitarianism asks 'what maximises welfare?' while Levinasian ethics asks 'how do I respond to the Other's demand?' The latter resists any calculation that would render the particular person invisible in aggregate analysis."

This suggests humility about universal claims. However, some standards seem necessary to critique injustice - without them, colonialism itself couldn't be condemned. This tension might be addressed by: distinguishing between thin universal protections (against torture, genocide) and thick conceptions of the good life that can vary; grounding universal claims in overlapping consensus across traditions rather than a single foundation; developing universal principles through genuine cross-cultural dialogue rather than imposition; remaining open to revision of universal claims in light of excluded perspectives. The goal is not to abandon universal ethics but to develop it more democratically and with greater epistemic humility."

Nietzsche critiqued slave morality to enable life-affirming values, not to eliminate values. Foucault's genealogies aimed to open space for alternative possibilities, not to render all positions equivalent. Levinas developed an ethics of responsibility that's arguably more demanding than traditional approaches. What postmodernism challenges is the idea that ethics can be grounded in universal reason accessible from nowhere. Alternative responses include: situating ethics in specific traditions (MacIntyre); grounding ethics in the encounter with the Other (Levinas); developing pragmatic approaches that work without foundations (Rorty). These retain ethical commitment while abandoning certain metaphysical claims. Relativism would only follow if we assume ethics requires universal foundations - precisely the assumption postmodernism questions."

This framework is provisional in several senses: it remains open to revision through experience and encounter with perspectives I haven't yet engaged; it acknowledges that my position shapes my ethical vision in ways I may not fully recognise; it treats coherence as a regulative ideal rather than a achieved state.

An integrated approach would require robust public deliberation that includes marginalised voices, strong precautionary principles given uncertainty, and attention to the social context that shapes what enhancement means.
