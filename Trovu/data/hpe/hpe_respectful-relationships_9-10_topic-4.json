Gender is about identity and how society sees people—it includes being a man, woman, or non-binary.\n\nGender identity is how you feel inside—whether you feel like a boy, a girl, both, or neither. Most people's gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth, but for some people it doesn't. Transgender people have a gender identity that's different from the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nGender expression is how you show your gender through clothes, hair, behaviour, and interests. Some people express their gender in ways that match what society expects, and some don't. There's no right or wrong way to express gender."

Gender stereotypes are ideas about how boys and girls, or men and women, should act, look, or be.\n\nCommon stereotypes say things like 'boys don't cry,' 'girls aren't good at maths,' 'men should be tough,' or 'women should be nurturing.' These stereotypes can be harmful because they limit what people feel they can do or be.\n\nStereotypes affect us from a young age. Think about toys—some are marketed to boys (like trucks and action figures) and some to girls (like dolls and play kitchens). But any child can play with any toy, regardless of gender.\n\nChallenging stereotypes means recognising when we're making assumptions based on gender, questioning those assumptions, and seeing people as individuals rather than as stereotypes."

They couldn't vote, own property, or do many jobs. While things have improved in Australia, inequality still exists—like in pay differences and in who does household work.\n\nPeople who don't fit traditional gender norms can face discrimination too. LGBTIQ+ people, including transgender people, may face prejudice and unfair treatment.\n\nEquality benefits everyone. When people aren't limited by gender expectations, they can pursue what matters to them, contribute their talents, and live more fully."

It can be obvious (like refusing to hire women) or subtle (like interrupting women more in meetings). Both forms are harmful.\n\nIf you experience or witness unfair treatment, it's okay to speak up (if safe), tell a trusted adult, and support the person who was treated unfairly."

If someone tells you their pronouns (like he/him, she/her, or they/them), use them. Using someone's correct pronouns shows respect for who they are.\n\nStand up against sexist comments or jokes. You don't have to laugh along with jokes that put down any gender. You can say 'That's not funny' or simply not participate.\n\nTreat everyone as equals in your friendships and activities. Include people regardless of gender. Listen to everyone's ideas and opinions equally.\n\nBe an ally.

While many people identify as either a man or a woman, others have different gender identities.\n\nNon-binary is an umbrella term for gender identities that aren't exclusively male or female. This might include people who feel like both genders, neither gender, or a gender that fluctuates. Some non-binary people use they/them pronouns.\n\nTransgender people have a gender identity that differs from the sex assigned at birth. Trans men are men who were assigned female at birth; trans women are women who were assigned male at birth. Being transgender is a normal variation of human experience.\n\nCisgender describes people whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth. Most people are cisgender, but this isn't 'normal' versus 'abnormal'—it's just one way of being.\n\nGender diverse and gender non-conforming are terms for people whose gender expression differs from societal expectations, whether or not they identify as transgender or non-binary.\n\nRespecting gender diversity means accepting that people know their own gender best, using people's correct names and pronouns, and not making assumptions based on appearance."

These aren't natural or fixed—they're created by society and can change over time and across cultures.\n\nChildren learn gender norms from a young age through family messages about gender, media representations, peer interactions, and school environment. By age 3-4, most children have a strong sense of gender and understand societal expectations.\n\nGender socialisation continues throughout life. Adolescence is particularly important as physical changes, peer pressure, and romantic relationships intensify gender expectations. The 'man box' describes restrictive expectations for boys around toughness and emotional suppression.\n\nGender norms vary across cultures. What's expected of men and women in one culture may be different in another. Within Australia, diverse cultural backgrounds bring different gender traditions.\n\nGender norms have changed over time. Activities once seen as only for one gender (like women working in offices or men doing childcare) are now common. This shows that gender expectations are social creations that can change."

While this has changed significantly, power imbalances continue.\n\nPower in personal relationships can show up in who makes decisions, who does more household work, who earns money, who has final say in disagreements, and whose needs are prioritised.\n\nHealthy relationships have relatively balanced power. Both people's views matter, decisions are made together, and neither person dominates the other.\n\nUnhealthy power dynamics occur when one person controls, dominates, or makes all the decisions. This might include financial control, isolation from friends, constant monitoring, or intimidation. These are warning signs of unhealthy or abusive relationships.\n\nGender interacts with power in relationships. Traditional gender norms can create expectations that men should be dominant and women submissive. Challenging these norms supports healthier, more equal relationships."

This might be obvious (like refusing to consider women for a job) or subtle (like interrupting women more or taking men's ideas more seriously).\n\nSexual harassment is unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature that makes someone feel intimidated, humiliated, or offended. It can include comments about someone's body, unwanted touching, sexual jokes, and sending unwanted sexual images. Sexual harassment can happen to anyone but often reflects gender power imbalances.\n\nHomophobia (prejudice against gay and lesbian people) and transphobia (prejudice against transgender people) are related forms of discrimination. They're often connected to gender expectations—for example, when boys are teased for being 'too feminine.'\n\nThe impacts of gender-based discrimination and harassment include limiting opportunities, damaging mental health, creating fear and exclusion, and reinforcing inequality. These impacts affect individuals and society.\n\nBystanders can make a difference. When you witness gender-based discrimination or harassment, you can speak up if safe, support the person affected, report to appropriate people, and refuse to participate in or laugh along with sexist behaviour."

Men can be allies for women's equality; cisgender people can be allies for transgender people. Allies listen, learn, speak up, and use whatever power they have to support those with less.\n\nEquality benefits everyone. Men are harmed by restrictive masculinity norms too.

They held sessions for all students about consent, respect, and sexual harassment. Boys had specific sessions about healthy masculinity and examining attitudes. Girls had sessions about their right to be safe and how to respond.\n\nThe school also made it easier to report concerns and made clear there would be consequences for harassment.

            "content": "Several theoretical frameworks help understand gender. Biological essentialism holds that gender differences are natural and fixed, based on biological differences between males and females. This view has been largely challenged by research showing the social construction of gender.\n\nSocial constructionism views gender as created through social interactions, institutions, and culture rather than being biologically determined. Gender roles and norms are learned, not innate, and can change.\n\nFeminist theory analyses gender as a system of power relations. It examines how societies privilege men over women and how gender intersects with other forms of inequality. Different feminist perspectives (liberal, radical, socialist, intersectional) offer different analyses and solutions.\n\nQueer theory challenges the binary categories of gender and sexuality. It questions the assumption that there are only two genders and examines how gender and sexuality norms are constructed and enforced.\n\nPoststructuralist approaches examine how gender is performed and produced through everyday actions and discourse. Judith Butler's concept of 'gender performativity' suggests gender is created through repeated acts rather than expressing an inner essence."

            "content": "Gender-based violence (GBV) is violence directed at someone because of their gender. It includes physical violence, sexual violence, emotional/psychological abuse, coercive control, economic abuse, and technology-facilitated abuse.\n\nWomen and girls experience higher rates of gender-based violence globally. In Australia, one in three women has experienced physical violence since age 15, and one in five has experienced sexual violence. Most perpetrators of violence against women are men known to them.\n\nLGBTIQ+ people also face elevated rates of violence, particularly transgender people. This violence is connected to gender norms and prejudice against those who challenge them.\n\nThe drivers of gender-based violence include gender inequality and unequal power relations, adherence to rigid gender norms (especially masculine norms around dominance), disrespect toward women and minimisation of violence, and social norms that condone or don't challenge violence.\n\nPrevention approaches address these drivers through education that challenges gender norms and builds respect, whole-of-community approaches to changing culture, organisational policies and accountability, and legal frameworks and enforcement."

            "content": "Intersectionality, coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, examines how multiple forms of inequality interact. Gender doesn't exist in isolation—it intersects with race, class, sexuality, disability, and other dimensions of identity.\n\nIntersectional analysis reveals that experiences of gender inequality differ based on other identities. For example, Indigenous women face both sexism and racism; disabled women face both sexism and ableism. These aren't simply added together—they create distinct experiences.\n\nIn Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women face specific intersecting oppressions rooted in colonisation. High rates of violence against Indigenous women reflect both gender inequality and ongoing colonial violence.\n\nWomen from culturally diverse backgrounds may face specific challenges including racism, language barriers, and cultural expectations around gender. Intersectional approaches avoid treating 'women' as a homogeneous group.\n\nIntersectionality also applies to understanding masculinity. Men of colour, working-class men, disabled men, and gay/bi men navigate masculinity differently than privileged white heterosexual men. Effective gender equality work considers these intersections."

Research consistently finds women are underrepresented in media, often portrayed in stereotypical roles, and frequently sexualised.\n\nThe male gaze (Laura Mulvey) describes how visual media often present women from a masculine perspective, as objects to be looked at rather than subjects with their own agency.\n\nMasculinity in media often emphasises aggression, emotional stoicism, and dominance. While there's increasing diversity, many media still reinforce traditional masculine norms.\n\nLGBTIQ+ representation has increased but remains limited and sometimes stereotyped. Positive, diverse representation matters for LGBTIQ+ young people's wellbeing and for shifting broader attitudes.\n\nMedia literacy involves critically analysing media representations—asking who is represented and how, what's missing, whose perspective is centred, and what effects these representations might have.\n\nSocial media creates both challenges and opportunities. It can spread harmful content but also provides platforms for diverse voices, gender activism, and challenging dominant narratives."

Multiple waves of feminism have addressed different issues over time.\n\nLGBTIQ+ activism has achieved marriage equality, anti-discrimination protections, and shifting attitudes. Activism continues around issues like transgender rights and safety.\n\nContemporary gender activism takes many forms: online campaigns and hashtags (#MeToo, #TimesUp), school-based activism, community organizing, lobbying for policy change, and cultural change work.\n\nYoung people are active in gender advocacy. Youth-led campaigns, student activism, and young voices in movements for change demonstrate that age doesn't prevent making a difference.\n\nBacklash and resistance exist. Progress on gender equality generates opposition from those who prefer traditional arrangements. Understanding resistance helps strategise for change.\n\nAllyship and solidarity are important. People with privilege in certain dimensions can support those with less. Men can be feminist allies; cisgender people can support transgender rights.

Hegemonic masculinity (Raewyn Connell) describes the culturally dominant form of masculinity that justifies men's domination. It's not the most common pattern of masculinity but the most legitimated—involving dominance, aggression, and heterosexuality. Most men don't fully embody hegemonic masculinity but position themselves in relation to it.\n\nFeminist standpoint theory (Sandra Harding, Patricia Hill Collins) argues that knowledge is situated—shaped by social position. Marginalised standpoints can reveal aspects of social reality invisible from dominant positions. Women's standpoints and intersectional standpoints offer distinctive insights.\n\nPostcolonial feminism examines how colonialism shapes gender relations and how Western feminism has sometimes imposed its frameworks on other cultures. It emphasises the diversity of women's experiences globally and challenges universalising claims.\n\nTransfeminism centres transgender perspectives in feminist analysis. It challenges cisgender assumptions in feminism and contributes to understanding gender as constructed and mutable.\n\nMasculinities studies examines how masculinity is constructed, the diversity of masculine expressions, and how masculine norms harm both women and men. It informs engaging men in gender equality work."

The gender pay gap in Australia remains around 14% at the national level, with wider gaps in some industries. Contributing factors include occupational segregation, undervaluation of female-dominated work, and discrimination.\n\nWorkforce participation differs by gender. Women do more unpaid care and domestic work, affecting their workforce participation and career progression. The 'motherhood penalty' sees women's earnings decline after having children while men's don't.\n\nRepresentation in leadership remains unequal. Women are underrepresented in parliament, corporate boards, and senior management positions despite making up half the population.\n\nViolence statistics reveal gendered patterns. One woman is killed by a current or former partner approximately every week in Australia. Men perpetrate the vast majority of violence against both women and men.\n\nHealth disparities show gendered patterns. Women live longer but experience more chronic illness. Men have higher rates of suicide, risk-taking injuries, and lower rates of help-seeking. Transgender people face significant health disparities.\n\nLGBTIQ+ young people experience higher rates of mental health issues, driven largely by discrimination and rejection rather than identity itself. Schools are significant sites of homophobia and transphobia."

            "content": "Various policy frameworks address gender inequality. Australia's National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children coordinates action across governments and sectors. It includes primary prevention, early intervention, response, and recovery components.\n\nWorkplace gender equality legislation requires large employers to report on gender equality indicators. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency tracks progress and recognises employers of choice.\n\nSex Discrimination legislation prohibits discrimination based on sex, pregnancy, and family responsibilities. It's been extended to include sexual harassment and, more recently, provisions on equal remuneration.\n\nEqual opportunity policies in organisations aim to address structural barriers. Strategies include targeted recruitment, flexible work arrangements, mentoring programs, and addressing workplace culture.\n\nPolicies on gender identity and expression are evolving. Legal recognition of gender identity, removal of surgery requirements for gender marker changes, and anti-discrimination protections vary across Australian jurisdictions.\n\nCritical policy analysis examines effectiveness—whether policies actually reduce inequality, who benefits, what's missing, and what barriers to implementation exist."

            "content": "Gender equality requires engaging men and boys, not just empowering women and girls. This involves examining masculine norms and their costs, understanding how men benefit from and are harmed by gender inequality, inviting men into gender equality work, and developing positive, equitable masculine identities.\n\nResearch on 'what works' with men and boys suggests that approaches challenging harmful masculine norms (like emotional suppression and dominance) while offering positive alternatives are more effective than approaches that shame men or treat masculinity as inherently problematic.\n\nThe 'man box' describes restrictive masculine norms—being tough, not showing emotion, being in control, being heterosexual. Research shows boys who most strongly subscribe to 'man box' attitudes have worse outcomes across multiple measures and are more likely to perpetrate harm.\n\nPrograms engaging men and boys include school-based programs addressing healthy masculinities, community mobilisation engaging men as allies, workplace programs on respectful behaviour, and fathers' programs supporting involved parenting.\n\nChallenges include potential for men to centre themselves rather than listening to women, performative allyship without genuine change, and resistance from those invested in maintaining male privilege."

International frameworks include the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which Australia has ratified, and the Sustainable Development Goals, which include gender equality.\n\nThe Global Gender Gap Report tracks countries' progress on economic participation, educational attainment, health, and political empowerment. Australia typically ranks in the top 50 but below many comparable countries, with economic participation and political empowerment being weaker areas.\n\nVariation across countries reflects different historical trajectories, cultural norms, legal frameworks, and economic conditions. Comparing approaches can identify what works while avoiding simplistic judgments about 'better' or 'worse' cultures.\n\nGlobal issues include child marriage, female genital cutting, maternal mortality, girls' education access, and women's political participation. These issues vary significantly by region and country.\n\nGlobal connections matter. Australia's policies and companies affect gender equality globally through trade, aid, and multinational operations. Global movements like #MeToo spread across borders while also being shaped by local contexts.\n\nColonialism and its ongoing effects shape gender globally. Understanding how colonialism disrupted Indigenous gender systems, imposed European gender norms, and created ongoing inequalities is essential for global gender analysis."

It asks young people to 'draw the line' against disrespect and abuse.\n\nContent includes videos and social media content featuring young people's voices, resources for discussing issues with peers, information about healthy relationships and warning signs, and practical guidance on being an active bystander.\n\nThe campaign operates within a prevention framework that recognises attitude change is necessary but not sufficient. It complements other primary prevention work, legal responses, and support services.\n\nEvaluation shows the campaign has reached millions of young Australians and has positive effects on attitudes. Challenges include translating attitude change to behaviour change, reaching those most at risk of perpetrating or experiencing violence, and sustaining change over time.\n\nThis case illustrates contemporary prevention approaches: addressing drivers rather than just symptoms, targeting young people as a key audience, using peer influence, and employing media effectively.",

Judith Butler's work on gender performativity argues gender is not an essence but is produced through repeated performances. There is no 'true' gender behind the acts—the acts themselves constitute gender. This denaturalises gender, revealing it as constructed rather than given.\n\nDeconstruction (Derrida) examines how gender categories rely on their opposites—'masculine' is defined against 'feminine.' These binaries are hierarchical (one term is privileged) and unstable. Deconstructing them reveals their constructed nature.\n\nFoucauldian analysis examines how power produces gender through discourse and disciplinary practices. Gender isn't repressed by power but constituted through it. Bodies are made gendered through medical, educational, legal, and everyday discourses.\n\nMaterialist feminism maintains focus on material conditions—economics, labour, bodies—alongside discourse. It critiques purely discursive analyses for potentially ignoring material inequalities and the specificity of sexed bodies.\n\nCritical trans studies centres transgender experiences and perspectives in gender theory. It challenges cisgender assumptions in feminist theory and contributes sophisticated analysis of how gender is constructed, embodied, and lived."

            "content": "Significant debates continue in gender theory. The sex/gender distinction debates examine the relationship between biological sex and social gender. Some argue sex itself is socially constructed; others maintain the materiality of sexed bodies while emphasising social construction of gender.\n\nEssentialism vs. constructionism debates continue. While most gender theorists are constructionists, debates exist about how far construction goes and what role biology plays. These aren't just academic—they affect policy and politics.\n\nTrans-exclusionary vs. trans-inclusive feminism is a contested area. Some feminists argue transgender women's experience is fundamentally different from cisgender women's, while intersectional and transfeminist approaches include trans women fully in feminism. These debates are heated and consequential.\n\nUniversalism vs. particularity debates examine whether 'woman' is a meaningful universal category across cultures and histories, or whether attention to specificity renders universal claims problematic. Intersectionality highlights diversity but still requires some grouping to make claims.\n\nRelations between academic theory and activism raise questions. Does academic theorising serve feminist goals or become disconnected from material struggles? How can theory and practice inform each other?"

Feminist alternatives include attending to power in research relationships, reflexivity about researcher positioning, research that serves women's interests, and valuing experiential knowledge.\n\nQuantitative approaches measure gender patterns, inequalities, and change over time. Large-scale surveys, administrative data analysis, and statistical methods document gendered patterns. Critiques note that quantification can miss nuance and qualitative dimensions.\n\nQualitative approaches explore gender experiences in depth. Interviews, ethnography, discourse analysis, and narrative methods reveal how gender is lived and constructed. They can capture complexity quantitative methods miss.\n\nParticipatory approaches involve those affected in research. Participatory action research with women's groups, youth participatory research, and community-based research centre affected communities in knowledge production.\n\nIntersectional methodologies attend to multiple dimensions of difference simultaneously. This might involve oversampling marginalised groups, disaggregating data by multiple dimensions, or centering particularly marginalised voices in qualitative work."

Youth advocacy is significant in gender equality movements.\n\nBacklash and resistance require analysis. Progress on gender equality generates opposition. Understanding the sources and strategies of backlash helps counter it effectively.\n\nIntersectional policy analysis examines how policies affect differently positioned groups. Policies that benefit some women may not benefit others. Centering those most marginalised can produce more inclusive policies.\n\nGlobal policy dimensions include international conventions and their domestic implementation, transnational advocacy networks, and the role of international institutions. Australia's compliance with international obligations and peer country comparisons provide accountability mechanisms."

Recognition that individual attitude change is necessary but insufficient is driving attention to institutional and structural change. This includes changing organisational cultures, policies, and systems.\n\nMasculinities work is expanding. Understanding masculinity as part of gender and engaging men are increasingly central to gender equality strategy. This includes research on diverse masculinities, programs addressing harmful norms, and involving men as allies.\n\nTrans inclusion is growing in gender equality work. As understanding of gender diversity deepens, inclusion of transgender and non-binary people in gender equality frameworks is expanding, though resistance continues.\n\nIntersectionality is being operationalised. Moving beyond intersectionality as a concept to intersectional practice in policy, research, and advocacy is an ongoing challenge.\n\nDigital dimensions are increasingly important. Online gender-based violence, algorithmic bias, and platform governance are emerging concerns. Digital tools also enable new forms of organising and advocacy.\n\nClimate and gender intersections are gaining attention. Climate change affects women disproportionately and requires gender-responsive approaches. Young climate activists are often also gender equality advocates.\n\nYouth leadership is growing in gender equality movements. Young people are at the forefront of contemporary advocacy, bringing new perspectives and strategies."
