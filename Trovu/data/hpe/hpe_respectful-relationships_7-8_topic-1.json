In future workplaces, awareness of power structures helps navigate professional relationships and advocate for fairness. In family relationships, understanding generational power helps maintain respect while developing autonomy. In future romantic relationships, recognising unhealthy power imbalances is protective. Similarly, repair skills transfer everywhere - knowing how to acknowledge hurt, take responsibility, and rebuild trust applies to conflicts with friends, family, colleagues, and partners. People with these skills can maintain relationships through challenges rather than abandoning them at the first difficulty, while also recognising when relationships can't be healthily maintained.",
