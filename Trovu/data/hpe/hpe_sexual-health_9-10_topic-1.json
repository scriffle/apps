Most people start puberty between ages 8 and 14. Puberty usually takes several years to complete.\n\nDuring puberty, hormones in your body cause changes. Hormones are chemical messengers that tell your body what to do. The main hormones involved in puberty are oestrogen and testosterone. Everyone has both of these hormones, but in different amounts.\n\nPuberty is a normal part of growing up. The changes might feel strange at first, but they are signs that your body is healthy and developing normally."

It's a normal part of the reproductive cycle.\n\nThe menstrual cycle prepares the body for pregnancy. If pregnancy doesn't happen, the lining of the uterus is shed. This is what causes a period.\n\nManaging periods:\n- Pads absorb blood on the outside of the body\n- Tampons or menstrual cups are worn inside the vagina\n- Period underwear absorbs blood like a pad\n- It's important to change pads and tampons regularly\n\nPeriod cramps are common. Heat packs, gentle exercise, and pain relief medication can help. If period pain is very severe, see a doctor."

These hormones travel through the bloodstream and cause the ovaries to produce oestrogen and the testes to produce testosterone.\n\nThe hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis controls puberty:\n1. The hypothalamus in the brain releases GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone)\n2. This signals the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH hormones\n3. These hormones tell the ovaries or testes to produce sex hormones\n4. These sex hormones cause the physical changes of puberty\n\nPuberty typically occurs in stages:\n- Early puberty: First signs appear (breast budding, testicular growth)\n- Mid-puberty: Growth spurts, more visible changes\n- Late puberty: Adult features develop, growth slows\n\nThe timing of puberty is influenced by genetics, nutrition, overall health, and environmental factors. In Australia, the average age of puberty onset has decreased over the past century due to improved nutrition and health."

A typical cycle lasts about 28 days, but anywhere from 21-35 days is considered normal.\n\nPhases of the menstrual cycle:\n\n1. Menstruation (Days 1-5): The uterine lining sheds, causing bleeding. This is the 'period.'\n\n2. Follicular Phase (Days 1-13): The pituitary gland releases FSH, which causes an egg to mature in the ovary. Oestrogen levels rise, thickening the uterine lining.\n\n3. Ovulation (Day 14): A mature egg is released from the ovary. This is when pregnancy can occur if the egg is fertilised by sperm.\n\n4. Luteal Phase (Days 15-28): The empty follicle becomes the corpus luteum and produces progesterone. If the egg isn't fertilised, hormone levels drop and menstruation begins again.\n\nCommon experiences during the menstrual cycle:\n- Cramps (caused by the uterus contracting)\n- Mood changes (caused by hormone fluctuations)\n- Bloating or breast tenderness\n- Changes in energy levels\n\nTracking periods using an app or calendar can help predict when the next period will come."

Understanding this system helps explain the wide variation in puberty timing and the cascade of physical changes.\n\nThe puberty process:\n\n1. Adrenarche (around age 6-8): The adrenal glands begin producing androgens (DHEA and androstenedione), causing early changes like body odour and some body hair. This precedes gonadarche by several years.\n\n2. Gonadarche (around age 8-13): The hypothalamus begins pulsing GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), activating the reproductive system. The pituitary responds by releasing gonadotropins (FSH and LH).\n\n3. Sexual maturation: Gonadotropins stimulate the gonads to produce sex steroids (oestrogen, progesterone, testosterone) which cause secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nTanner stages provide a clinical framework for tracking puberty development, using standardised descriptions of breast/genital development and pubic hair growth through five stages from prepubertal (Stage 1) to adult (Stage 5).\n\nFactors influencing puberty timing:\n- Genetics (50-80% of variation)\n- Nutrition and body composition\n- Chronic illness\n- Environmental factors (endocrine-disrupting chemicals)\n- Psychosocial stress"

Of these, only about 400-500 will mature and be released during a woman's reproductive years.\n\nThe menstrual cycle involves complex hormonal feedback loops:\n- Follicular phase: Rising FSH stimulates follicle development; one follicle becomes dominant. The growing follicle produces oestrogen, which thickens the endometrium.\n- Ovulation: Oestrogen peak triggers LH surge, causing the dominant follicle to rupture and release the oocyte.\n- Luteal phase: The empty follicle becomes the corpus luteum, producing progesterone to maintain the endometrium. If no pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum degenerates, hormones drop, and menstruation begins.\n\nMale reproductive system:\n\nSpermatogenesis (sperm production) begins at puberty and continues throughout life. The process takes approximately 64-74 days from stem cell to mature sperm. The testes produce 100-200 million sperm daily.\n\nTestosterone production follows a diurnal pattern (highest in the morning) and is regulated by the HPG axis through negative feedback loops."

Requires medical evaluation.\n\nDelayed puberty: No signs of puberty by age 13 in females or 14 in males. Often constitutional (runs in families and development eventually catches up) but should be evaluated to rule out underlying conditions.\n\nVariations in sex characteristics:\nSome individuals are born with differences in sex development (DSD), previously called intersex conditions. These include variations in chromosomes, gonads, hormones, or anatomy. Examples include:\n- Androgen insensitivity syndrome\n- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n- Turner syndrome (45,X)\n- Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY)\n\nThese variations are part of natural human diversity.

            "content": "The HPG axis operates through complex feedback mechanisms that integrate with other hormonal systems.\n\nPulsatile GnRH secretion:\nThe hypothalamus releases GnRH in pulses rather than continuously. Pulse frequency affects which gonadotropin is preferentially released:\n- High frequency pulses favour LH secretion\n- Low frequency pulses favour FSH secretion\n\nThis pulsatile pattern is essential for normal reproductive function. Continuous GnRH (as in GnRH agonist medications) actually suppresses the reproductive axis, which is why GnRH agonists are used for puberty suppression in gender-affirming care and treatment of precocious puberty.\n\nIntegration with other systems:\n\nHPA-HPG interaction: The stress axis (HPA) can suppress the reproductive axis. Chronic stress increases cortisol, which inhibits GnRH release. This explains why severe stress, excessive exercise, or eating disorders can cause amenorrhea.\n\nMetabolic-reproductive links: Leptin (produced by fat tissue) signals adequate energy stores to the hypothalamus, permitting reproductive function. Low leptin levels (from low body fat) suppress GnRH release, which is why underweight individuals may experience delayed puberty or amenorrhea.\n\nThyroid-reproductive interaction: Thyroid hormones affect reproductive function at multiple levels. Hypothyroidism can cause menstrual irregularities and affect fertility.\n\nCircadian influences: Reproductive hormones follow daily rhythms. Testosterone peaks in the morning. Melatonin affects GnRH secretion. Disrupted sleep patterns can affect reproductive function."

Critiques include:\n- Pathologises natural variation\n- Separates body from social context\n- Privileges medical expertise over lived experience\n\nSocial constructionism:\nThis perspective examines how understandings of puberty and reproduction are shaped by social and cultural contexts. What counts as 'normal' puberty, what symptoms warrant concern, and how bodies are valued all vary across cultures and historical periods. Puberty itself is a social category, not just a biological event.\n\nFeminist perspectives:\nFeminist scholars have critiqued how women's reproductive bodies have been pathologised and controlled. Key contributions include:\n- Challenging the medicalisation of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause\n- Documenting gender bias in medical research and practice\n- Advocating for reproductive autonomy and bodily sovereignty\n- Analysing how reproductive politics intersect with race, class, and disability\n\nEmily Martin's work on menstruation as 'failed production' showed how cultural values shape biomedical descriptions.\n\nQueer and trans perspectives:\nThese frameworks challenge assumptions that bodies are simply male or female and that reproductive capacity defines identity. They examine:\n- How puberty is experienced by gender diverse young people\n- The politics of medical gatekeeping in gender-affirming care\n- Alternative kinship and family structures\n- Reproductive futures beyond heteronormative assumptions\n\nIndigenous perspectives:\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge systems offer holistic understandings of health that connect body, spirit, country, and community. Colonisation disrupted these knowledge systems, and contemporary approaches should support Indigenous self-determination in health knowledge and practice."

            "title": "Ethics of Reproductive Health",
            "content": "Reproductive health raises profound ethical questions about autonomy, justice, and the proper role of medicine and the state.\n\nAutonomy and consent:\nThe principle of bodily autonomy holds that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. In reproductive health, this includes:\n- Access to information about one's own body\n- Freedom from unwanted medical intervention\n- Access to desired interventions (contraception, gender-affirming care)\n- Reproductive decision-making\n\nFor young people, autonomy is balanced against protective concerns. Gillick competence provides a framework, but debates continue about:\n- At what age/maturity can young people make reproductive health decisions?\n- What role should parents play?\n- How do we balance autonomy with protection from harm?\n\nJustice and equity:\nDistributive justice asks how the benefits and burdens of reproductive health should be distributed. Questions include:\n- Who has access to reproductive healthcare and technologies?\n- How should limited resources be allocated?\n- What obligations exist to address historical injustices (e.g., forced sterilisation of disabled and Indigenous women)?\n\nEpistemics:\nEpistemic justice concerns whose knowledge is valued. In reproductive health:\n- Medical expertise often overrides patient experience\n- Women's pain has historically been dismissed\n- Traditional knowledge systems have been devalued\n- Marginalised groups' experiences may not be represented in research\n\nEmerging technologies:\nNew technologies raise novel ethical questions:\n- Genetic testing and selection\n- Fertility preservation for young people\n- Uterus transplantation\n- Artificial wombs\n- Gene editing\n\nThese technologies require consideration of who benefits, who is harmed, and what values should guide development and access."

Key policy areas include:\n- Medicare and PBS coverage of reproductive health services\n- Sexuality education curriculum\n- Regulation of reproductive technologies\n- Access to abortion (recently decriminalised in all states/territories)\n- Gender-affirming healthcare\n- Indigenous health\n\nPolicy analysis frameworks:\nUseful approaches include:\n- Stakeholder analysis: Who is affected? Who has power? Whose voices are heard?\n- Evidence analysis: What evidence informs policy? What evidence is missing?\n- Values analysis: What values are embedded in policy? Whose values?\n- Implementation analysis: What are barriers to implementation? What are unintended consequences?\n\nCase study - HPV vaccination:\nAustralia was an early adopter of universal HPV vaccination, now showing significant declines in HPV-related conditions. Policy success factors included:\n- Strong evidence base\n- School-based delivery reducing access barriers\n- Bipartisan political support\n- Extension to boys addressing equity and reducing transmission\n\nChallenges included initial framing around cervical cancer (ignoring other HPV cancers), religious opposition, and lower uptake in some communities.\n\nYouth participation in policy:\nMeaningful youth participation in policy-making is increasingly recognised as essential for effective youth health policy. Models include youth advisory groups, co-design processes, and youth-led research and advocacy."

This framing justifies medical management and symptom suppression. Cultural taboos and the male dominance of medicine have shaped how menstruation is understood and treated. Premenstrual experiences have been pathologised (PMS, PMDD) in ways that reinforce gendered stereotypes.

Arguments against: concerns about long-term effects; questions about whether young people can give informed consent; potential pressure from social contagion (critiqued as unsupported). Evaluation: the weight of evidence and ethical reasoning supports access within appropriate care frameworks. Autonomy-based arguments are strong; paternalistic restrictions may cause more harm than they prevent. However, care should include psychological support and informed consent processes."
