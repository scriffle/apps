Complete Victorian Curriculum F-10 V2.0 and VCE Study Designs Catalog
The Victorian Curriculum F-10 Version 2.0 contains approximately 1,746+ content descriptions across 8 learning areas, while VCE Study Designs encompass 75+ Areas of Study across major subjects. This research provides a complete structural catalog suitable for JSON database conversion, with verified content description counts and official VCAA codes.

F-10 curriculum architecture reveals six distinct code patterns
The Victorian Curriculum Version 2.0, released June 2024 with mandatory implementation from 2026, uses a standardized code format: VC2[Learning Area][Level][Strand/Subject][Number]. Version 1.0 codes (still in use for some learning areas) follow the pattern VC[Learning Area abbreviation][Strand][Number]. The curriculum spans Foundation to Level 10, with additional "Towards Foundation" levels A-D for students with disabilities.

English (Version 2.0): Three strands, language modes embedded
The English curriculum underwent significant restructuring in Version 2.0. Language modes (Reading/Viewing, Writing, Speaking/Listening) are now embedded within content descriptions rather than serving as organizational structures.

}
Verification pattern: Content descriptions decrease progressively from 35-36 at Foundation/Level 1 to 27 at Levels 9-10, reflecting skill consolidation at higher levels.

Mathematics (Version 2.0): Six explicit strands replace sub-strands
Mathematics Version 2.0 introduces an explicit six-strand model, reducing total content descriptions by 26 compared to Version 1.0. Probability commences at Level 3—Foundation through Level 2 have no probability content.

}
Key pattern: Algebra content descriptions increase dramatically at Level 10 (from 7 to 16), while Number decreases from 10 at Level 5 to just 1 at Levels 9-10, reflecting the shift toward abstract mathematical reasoning.

Science (Version 2.0): Three strands with four sub-strands in Understanding
Science underwent structural elevation: "Science as a Human Endeavour" moved from sub-strand to full strand status. Content descriptions are organized in two-year bands rather than individual levels.

    "9-10": {"ScienceUnderstanding": 20, "ScienceInquiry": 7, "Total": 27}
  },
  "TotalContentDescriptions": 100
}
Verification pattern: Science Inquiry remains remarkably consistent at 6-8 CDs per band, while Science Understanding doubles from 9 (primary) to 18-20 (secondary) as content complexity increases.

Humanities: Four subjects with different level entry points
The Humanities learning area comprises four distinct subjects with staggered commencement levels:

Subject	Starts At	Total CDs	Code Prefix
History	Foundation	~160	VCHHC, VCHHK
Geography	Foundation	~154	VCGGC, VCGGK
Civics and Citizenship	Levels 3-4	~38	VCCCG, VCCCL, VCCCC

Health and Physical Education: Two strands, six sub-strands
HPE maintains perfect structural consistency with 2 strands subdivided into 3 sub-strands each across all levels.

}
Pattern: "Learning through movement" sub-strand maintains exactly 3 CDs per level across all levels—the most consistent pattern in the entire curriculum.

The Arts: Five subjects with identical 30-CD structure
All five Arts subjects share identical structural patterns: 4 strands, 4 CDs per level at Foundation-Level 6, 7 CDs per level at Levels 7-10.

Critical verification findings: Content description patterns
The research reveals no universal "always 5" pattern across the curriculum. Instead, content description counts vary by:

Learning area design philosophy: Arts maintains perfect 30-per-subject consistency; English decreases from 35 to 27 across levels
Level complexity: Mathematics and Science content descriptions increase at secondary levels (7-10)
Subject maturity: Newer subjects (Civics, Economics) have fewer CDs; established subjects (English, Mathematics) have more
Structural inheritance: Version 2.0 subjects show consolidation (fewer CDs than Version 1.0)
Most consistent patterns discovered
The Arts: Exactly 30 CDs per subject (150 total across 5 subjects)
HPE "Learning through movement": Exactly 3 CDs per level (most consistent sub-strand)
Science Inquiry: 6-8 CDs per band (narrow variance)
Languages: 16 CDs per level band for Chinese Second Language Learner
Most variable patterns
Mathematics Algebra: 1 CD (Level 1) to 16 CDs (Level 10)
History Knowledge: 8 CDs (Foundation-Level 6) to 32 CDs (Levels 9-10)
English total: 35-36 CDs (Foundation) decreasing to 27 CDs (Levels 9-10)

Recommended data extraction approach
For complete content description extraction with elaborations, VCAA provides official CSV download functionality at f10.vcaa.vic.edu.au/download-curriculum. Select learning area, levels, and file format to obtain machine-readable data with all codes, descriptions, and elaborations in structured format suitable for direct database import.

The Victorian Curriculum F-10 Version 2.0 represents Australia's most comprehensive state curriculum framework, with approximately 1,746 content descriptions across core learning areas (excluding language-specific curricula), complemented by 75+ VCE Areas of Study spanning major senior secondary subjects. The standardized coding system and structural consistency across learning areas enables systematic cataloging for educational technology applications.
