        "htmlContent": "In 1924, Louis de Broglie hypothesised that {{q1_dropdown}}, not just photons, must have {{q2_dropdown}} properties and an associated {{q3_dropdown}} that depends on their momentum. The de Broglie wavelength can be calculated using the formula {{q4_dropdown}}, where h is {{q5_dropdown}} with a value of {{q6_dropdown}} J·s. When electrons travel through {{q7_dropdown}} gaps, like the spaces between {{q8_dropdown}} in a crystal lattice, they produce {{q9_dropdown}} patterns that demonstrate their wave nature. For macroscopic objects like a tennis ball, the de Broglie wavelength is {{q10_dropdown}} to be measured, which is why we don't observe {{q11_dropdown}} when such objects pass through {{q12_dropdown}}.",
