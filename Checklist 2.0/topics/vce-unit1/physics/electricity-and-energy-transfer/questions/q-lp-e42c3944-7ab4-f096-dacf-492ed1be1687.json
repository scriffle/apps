      "question": "For continuously varying current, total charge is found by calculating the [[area]] under the current-time graph.",
      "correctAnswer": "area",
      "correctExplanation": "Since Q = I × t for constant current, the product represents area (height × width). For varying current, integrating I(t)dt gives the area under the curve, which equals total charge.",

        "slope",

      "question": "The relationship between charge and current can be expressed differentially as i = [[dq/dt]], meaning instantaneous current is the rate of change of charge.",
      "correctAnswer": "dq/dt",
      "correctExplanation": "The derivative dq/dt gives instantaneous current at any moment. This is the calculus form of I = Q/t, applicable when current varies with time.",
