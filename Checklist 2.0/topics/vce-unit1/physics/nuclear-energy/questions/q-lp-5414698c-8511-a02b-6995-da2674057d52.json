        "Mass-energy is conserved; mass is converted to an equivalent amount of energy",
        "Mass cannot change in any process",
        "Nuclear reactions create mass, not destroy it",
        "Only chemical reactions can change mass"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Total mass-energy is always conserved. Mass isn't destroyed but transforms into energy. The reaction products plus released energy equal the initial mass-energy."
