  "icon": "🌀",
  "what": "This subtopic explores how gravity shapes the universe by warping space, pulling matter together through accretion, enabling nuclear fusion in stars, and driving the formation of solar systems.",
  "why": "Gravity is responsible for creating nearly every large structure in the universe. Understanding gravity as a creative force explains how planets, stars, galaxies, and even the atoms in your body came to exist.",

      "title": "I can explain gravity as mass warping space using Einstein's general relativity",
      "code": "2.1",
      "what": "Einstein's theory describes gravity not as a pulling force, but as mass curving the fabric of space. Objects follow curved paths through this warped space, which we perceive as gravitational attraction.",
      "why": "This model explains why gravity only attracts and never repels, why objects fall together, and why massive objects like black holes can bend light. It replaced Newton's simpler but less complete model.",
      "example": "Imagine a heavy ball on a stretched rubber sheet creating a dip. A smaller ball rolled nearby will curve toward the dip. Similarly, Earth warps space around it, and the Moon follows a curved path through that warped space."

      "title": "I can describe accretion and its role in forming cosmic structures",
      "code": "2.2",
      "what": "Accretion is the process where smaller objects come together under gravity to form larger ones. This process builds planets, stars, galaxies, and even black holes over time.",
      "why": "Accretion explains how dust and gas become planets and stars. Without this gravity-driven process, the universe would remain a diffuse cloud of particles with no structure.",
      "example": "In the early solar system, tiny dust grains collided and stuck together, gradually forming larger rocks, then planetesimals, and eventually planets like Earth over millions of years."

      "title": "I can explain how gravity enables nuclear fusion in stars",
      "code": "2.3",
      "what": "Gravity compresses a star's core to extreme temperatures and pressures, allowing nuclear fusion to occur. In fusion, lighter atomic nuclei combine to form heavier ones, releasing enormous energy.",
      "why": "Nuclear fusion is the source of all starlight and the process that creates most elements on the periodic table. Without gravity creating these extreme conditions, fusion could not occur naturally.",
      "example": "In the Sun's core, gravity creates temperatures of 15 million degrees Celsius. At this temperature, hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium, releasing the energy that makes the Sun shine."

      "title": "I can describe stellar nucleosynthesis and the origin of elements",
      "code": "2.4",
      "what": "Stars create heavier elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. Regular stars fuse elements up to iron (Fe, atomic number 26). Elements heavier than iron are created during supernova explosions.",
      "why": "Every atom in your body heavier than hydrogen was created inside a star. Understanding stellar nucleosynthesis reveals that we are literally made of star material.",
      "example": "The carbon in your cells, the oxygen you breathe, and the calcium in your bones were all forged in the core of ancient stars. The gold in jewellery was created in a supernova explosion."

      "id": 5,
      "title": "I can explain hydrostatic equilibrium in stars",
      "code": "2.5",
      "what": "Hydrostatic equilibrium is the balance between gravity pulling inward and radiation pressure from fusion pushing outward. This balance keeps stars stable for millions or billions of years.",
      "why": "Without this balance, stars would either collapse under gravity or explode from radiation pressure. Understanding equilibrium explains why stars have predictable lifespans based on their mass.",
      "example": "The Sun has maintained hydrostatic equilibrium for 4.6 billion years. If fusion suddenly stopped, gravity would collapse the core. If gravity suddenly weakened, the radiation pressure would cause the Sun to expand."

      "id": 6,
      "title": "I can describe the five stages of solar system development",
      "code": "2.6",
      "what": "Solar systems form through five stages: nebula formation, protoplanetary disk formation, nuclear fusion ignition in the central star, planetary accretion, and finally the habitability stage.",
      "why": "This sequence explains how our solar system formed and provides a framework for understanding the many exoplanet systems now being discovered around other stars.",
      "example": "Our solar system began as a collapsing gas cloud (nebula), flattened into a spinning disk, ignited fusion in the proto-Sun, formed planets through accretion, and eventually developed conditions suitable for life on Earth."
